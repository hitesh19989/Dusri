1
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:16,068
Okay. Hold on.
Don't shoot.

2
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,639
You see where you're going?

3
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,154
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

4
00:00:20,338 --> 00:00:22,588
Now let's worry about
how you get there.

5
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,399
Point your toe this way.

6
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:29,274
Hips, here. Okay?

7
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,952
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:33,251
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:35,279
How about now?
Can you see now?

10
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:36,716
How about now?

11
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,232
All right.

12
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:41,859
Ready? Three fingers.

13
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:43,676
Nice!

14
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:48,074
- Nice throw, kiddo!
- Here you go.

15
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:52,016
Hey, you guys want mayo
or mustard, or both?

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,464
Who wants mayo on a hotdog?

17
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:58,045
Pardon your brothers. Two mustard,
please! Thanks, momma.

18
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,265
Got it.

19
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,626
Nate, mayo or mustard?

20
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,658
I want ketchup.

21
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:07,580
Mind your elbow...

22
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:12,455
Good job, Hawkeye!
Go get your arrow.

23
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:18,692
Hey, guys. Enough practice.
Soup's on.

24
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:22,187
All right. We're coming.
We're hungry.

25
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,750
Lila, let's go.

26
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:28,850
Lila?

27
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:32,633
Honey?

28
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:37,828
Hey, Babe?

29
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:48,377
Babe?

30
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:51,364
Babe?

31
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:54,616
Boys!

32
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,875
Boys?

33
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,863
Laura?

34
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:46,658
You don't need to do that,

35
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:49,099
because you're just
holding the position.

36
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:51,677
Come on.

37
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:53,223
That was close.

38
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,327
That's a goal. We're
now one a-piece.

39
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,009
I would like to try again.

40
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,287
We're tied up.

41
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,484
Feel the tension? It's fun.

42
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:07,268
That was terrible. Now you
have a chance to win.

43
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:10,520
And you won.
Congratulations.

44
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,271
Fair game.

45
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,484
Good sport.

46
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:17,096
You had fun?

47
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,385
It was fun.

48
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:44,781
This thing on?

49
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:49,425
Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.

50
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,217
If you find this recording...

51
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:58,089
don't post it, on social media.
It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.

52
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,886
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

53
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,834
I don't even know
if you're still...

54
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,717
Oh, God. I hope so...

55
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:11,040
Today is day 21... uh, 22.

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,837
You know, if it wasn't for
the existential terror of

57
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:17,002
staring into the
literal void of space,

58
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,191
I'd say, I'm feeling
more better today.

59
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:23,439
The infection's run its course,
thanks to the blue meanie back there.

60
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,355
You'd love her. Very practical.

61
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,777
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

62
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:37,709
Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but
we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge

63
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:40,592
to buy ourselves, about,
48 hours of playtime.

64
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,160
But it's now dead in the water.

65
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,187
We're 1,000 light years
from the nearest 7-11.

66
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,506
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning.

67
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,259
And that'll be it.

68
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,087
And Pep, I...

69
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:03,527
I know I said no
more surprises, but

70
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:06,788
I gotta say, I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.

71
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,147
But it looks like...

72
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:10,915
Well, you know what
it looks like.

73
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,826
Don't feel bad about this.

74
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,938
I mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks,

75
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:20,560
and then, move on
with enormous guilt...

76
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:29,795
I should probably lie down.
I'm gonna caress my eyes.

77
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,736
Please know...

78
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:38,429
When I drift off, it will
be like everything lately.

79
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,493
I'm fine... Totally fine.

80
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:44,955
I'll dream about you.

81
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:47,760
Because it's always you.

82
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:13,022
- Couldn't stop him.
- Neither could I.

83
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,585
I lost the kid.

84
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:22,224
Tony, we lost.

85
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:25,970
Is, umm...

86
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:28,183
Oh, my God!

87
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,576
It's okay.

88
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,978
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.

89
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:50,668
World governments are in pieces.

90
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:54,320
The parts that are still working
are trying to take a census.

91
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,474
And it looks like he did...

92
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:03,033
He did exactly what he said he
was gonna do. Thanos wiped out...

93
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,559
...fifty percent of
all living creatures.

94
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:13,595
Where is he now? Where?

95
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:15,401
We don't know.

96
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:18,745
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

97
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,021
What's wrong with him?

98
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:24,977
He's pissed.

99
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:27,803
He thinks he failed.

100
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,867
Which of course he did, but there's a
lot of that goin' around, ain't there?

101
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,913
Honestly, at this exact second, I
thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

102
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:35,833
Maybe I am.

103
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,201
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

104
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:41,969
Deep space scans, and
satellites, and we got nothing.

105
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,374
- Tony you fought him.
- Who told you that?

106
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:47,515
Didn't fight him.

107
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,835
No. He wiped my face
with a planet while a

108
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,206
Bleecker Street magician
gave away the stone.

109
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,074
- That's what happened. There was no fight...
- Okay.

110
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:57,562
Did he give you any clues?
Any coordinates, anything?

111
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,502
Pfft!

112
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:03,785
I saw this coming a few years back. I
had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

113
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,769
Thought I was dreaming.

114
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:08,670
- Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.
- And I needed you.

115
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:13,194
As in, past tense. That trumps what
you need. It's too late, buddy.

116
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:14,456
Sorry.

117
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:18,176
You know what I need?
I need to shave.

118
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:22,476
- And I believe I remember telling,
- Tony, Tony, Tony...

119
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:24,424
why that otherwise,

120
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:28,906
that what we needed, was a suit of armor
around the world. Remember that?

121
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:33,379
Whether it impacted our precious
freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.

122
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,945
- Well that didn't work out, did it?
- I said we'd lose.

123
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:38,935
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."

124
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,624
Well guess what,
Cap? We lost.

125
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:44,064
You weren't there.

126
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:47,479
But that's what we do, right?
Our best work after the fact?

127
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:50,747
We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?

128
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:53,469
Okay. You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

129
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:56,029
- No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.
- Tony, sit, sit down!

130
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:58,598
We need you. You're new blood.
Bunch of tired old mills...

131
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:02,118
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,

132
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:05,054
no clues, no strategies,
no options...

133
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,038
Zero. Zip. Nada. No
trust, you liar...

134
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:16,572
Here, take this. You find
him and you put that on.

135
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,553
You hide.

136
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,096
- Tony!
- I'm fine. I...

137
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:34,215
Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna
probably be out for the rest of the day.

138
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:37,936
You guys take care of him. And I'll bring
an Bezurian elixir when I come back.

139
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:41,062
- Where are you going?
- To kill Thanos.

140
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:45,159
Hey.

141
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:47,794
You know we usually work
as a team here, and

142
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:49,794
between you and I we're
also a little fragile.

143
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:53,422
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight, too.

144
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:55,970
- You even know where he is?
- I know people who might.

145
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:57,563
Don't bother.

146
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:00,690
I can tell you where Thanos is.

147
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,609
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

148
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:10,110
And when he worked, he
talked about his great plan.

149
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:13,240
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.

150
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:17,842
I'd ask, where would we go
once his plan was complete?

151
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,028
His answer was always the same.

152
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:26,326
To The Garden.

153
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:29,559
That's cute. Thanos has
a retirement plan.

154
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,291
So where is he?

155
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:33,103
When Thanos snapped his fingers,

156
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:37,662
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

157
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,993
No one's ever seen anything like it...
until two days ago.

158
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:45,424
On this planet.

159
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,223
Thanos is there.

160
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,412
He used the stones again.

161
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:51,816
Hey, hey, hey...

162
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,871
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?

163
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:57,350
- Look, he still got the stones, so...
- So let's get him.

164
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:00,523
- We use them to bring everyone back.
- Just like that?

165
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:02,515
Yeah. Just like that.

166
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,697
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

167
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:08,480
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

168
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:12,750
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

169
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:14,936
Because before, you
didn't have me.

170
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:19,485
Hey, new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.

171
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,444
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?

172
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:25,017
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

173
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:27,864
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.

174
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:48,730
I like this one.

175
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:56,576
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.

176
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:22,154
Okay. Who here hasn't
been to space?

177
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:26,781
You better not throw
up on my ship.

178
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:30,377
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.

179
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:46,028
I'll head down for recon.

180
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:06,787
- This is gonna work, Steve.
- I know it will.

181
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:13,399
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

182
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:19,246
No satellites, no ships, no armies,
no ground defenses of any kind.

183
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,162
It's just him.

184
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:24,882
Then that's enough.

185
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:55,639
Oh, no.

186
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,615
Where are they?

187
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:09,297
Answer the question.

188
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,603
The universe
required correction.

189
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:18,971
After that, the stones served
no purpose, beyond temptation.

190
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:20,816
You murdered trillions!

191
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:23,839
You should be grateful.

192
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,735
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

193
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,821
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

194
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:38,026
I used the stones to
destroy the stones.

195
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,512
It nearly killed me.

196
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:45,923
But the work is done.
It always will be.

197
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:51,771
I am inevitable.

198
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,360
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.

199
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,051
My father is many things.

200
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:01,050
A liar is not one of them.

201
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,055
Thank you, Daughter.

202
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:11,199
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

203
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,549
What... what did you do?

204
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,619
I went for the head.

205
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:36,407
So I, uh...

206
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:40,229
Went on a date the other day.

207
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:45,176
It's the first time in five years,
you know? Sit there, dinner...

208
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,061
I didn't know what
to talk about.

209
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,586
What did you talk about?

210
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,863
Same old crap, you know? How
things have changed, and...

211
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,161
My job, his job...

212
00:20:57,646 --> 00:21:00,108
How much we miss the Mets.

213
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:04,247
Then things get quiet..

214
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:09,341
He cried as they were
serving the salads.

215
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,295
What about you?

216
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,634
I cried just before dessert.

217
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:22,223
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

218
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:23,443
That's great.

219
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:25,271
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump, you

220
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,548
didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

221
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:32,502
And that's it. That's those little,
brave baby steps you gotta take.

222
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:36,100
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.

223
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,843
I went in the ice in '45 right
after I met the love of my life.

224
00:21:43,143 --> 00:21:45,067
Woke up 70 years later.

225
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,279
You got to move on.

226
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:53,933
Got to move on.

227
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,188
The world is in our hands.

228
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:03,463
It's left to us guys.

229
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:06,254
And we got to do
something with it.

230
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:08,223
Otherwise...

231
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,184
Thanos should've
killed all of us.

232
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,577
What the hell?

233
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:28,440
Hope?

234
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:04,356
Kid! Hey, kid!

235
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:10,816
What the hell happened here?

236
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:43,668
My God...

237
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,407
No. Please. Please, please.
No, no, no...

238
00:24:57,488 --> 00:25:00,177
Excuse me. Sorry.
No, Cassie, no.

239
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:01,826
No.

240
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:03,851
No, no.

241
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:07,355
Please, please,
please, please...

242
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:08,489
No, Cassie...

243
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,461
What?

244
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,002
Cassie?

245
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Dad?

246
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,211
You're so big!

247
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:36,743
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.

248
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:38,824
It was an infectious
garbage scowl.

249
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,356
So, thanks for the hot tip.

250
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,217
- Well, you were closer.
- Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

251
00:26:43,242 --> 00:26:45,115
You get a reading
on those tremors?

252
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,634
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.

253
00:26:47,753 --> 00:26:50,168
Do we have a visual? How
are we handling it?

254
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:53,436
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.

255
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:56,437
We handle it by not handling it.

256
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:59,619
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

257
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:02,699
- Not likely.
- What, you gonna get another haircut?

258
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:06,362
Listen, fur-face. I'm
covering a lot of territory.

259
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:08,166
The things that are
happening on Earth are

260
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:11,267
happening everywhere, on
thousands of planets.

261
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,994
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

262
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:17,209
So you might not see
me for a long time.

263
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,373
All right. Uh, well...

264
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:24,320
This channel is always active.
So, anything goes sideways...

265
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,814
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

266
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,964
- Comes through me.
- Okay.

267
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,981
All right.

268
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:33,404
Good luck.

269
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:44,094
- Where are you?
- Mexico.

270
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:47,104
The federals found a
room full of bodies.

271
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:50,734
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never
even had the chance to get their guns off.

272
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:54,174
- It's probably a rival gang...
- Except it isn't.

273
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:56,175
It's definitely Barton.

274
00:27:56,724 --> 00:28:01,651
What he's done here, what he's
been doing for the last few years,

275
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:04,750
I mean, the scene
that he left...

276
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:08,628
I gotta tell you, there's a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.

277
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,800
Will you find out where
he's going next?

278
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:21,766
Nat...

279
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,532
Please.

280
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,166
Yeah.

281
00:28:36,985 --> 00:28:41,242
You know I'd offer to cook you dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already.

282
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:46,217
You here to do your laundry?

283
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:48,164
And to see a friend.

284
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:50,987
Clearly, your friend is fine.

285
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:56,947
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.

286
00:28:56,972 --> 00:29:00,091
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

287
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:04,156
You know, if you're about to tell
me to look on the bright side...

288
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,702
Um...

289
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:10,572
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

290
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:15,309
Sorry. Force of habit.

291
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:33,609
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and... grow.

292
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:36,705
Some do.

293
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,412
But not us.

294
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:46,601
- If I move on, who does this?
- Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

295
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,208
I used to have nothing.

296
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:56,437
And then I got this.

297
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:00,025
This job.

298
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,184
This family.

299
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:12,050
And I was... I was
better because of it.

300
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:20,064
And even though...

301
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:22,411
they're gone...

302
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:28,345
Now, I'm still
trying to be better.

303
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,711
I think we both
need to get a life.

304
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:37,799
You first.

305
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:44,413
Oh... Hi. Hi!

306
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:47,381
Is anyone home?
This is Scott Lang.

307
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:52,057
We met a few years ago,
at the airport? In Germany?

308
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:54,950
I got really big and
I had my mask on.

309
00:30:54,975 --> 00:30:56,896
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

310
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,853
Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I
know you know that.

311
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:00,963
It's the front gate.

312
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:02,795
I need to talk to you guys.

313
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:09,664
Scott.

314
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:13,016
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

315
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:17,238
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?

316
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:19,684
Only in mid-conversation.

317
00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:21,172
Alright. So...

318
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:26,635
Five years ago, right before...
Thanos,

319
00:31:26,738 --> 00:31:28,974
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

320
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:32,015
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.

321
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,682
To get in there, you have to be
incredibly small. Hope, she's my...

322
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:39,057
She... she was my...

323
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:44,680
She was supposed to pull me out.
And then Thanos happened, and

324
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:48,378
- I got stuck in there.
- Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.

325
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:51,076
Yeah, but that's just it.
It wasn't.

326
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,819
For me it was five hours.

327
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,409
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

328
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,887
Everything is unpredictable. Is that
anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.

329
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,201
Scott.

330
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,178
What are you talking about?

331
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,271
So...

332
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:07,171
What I'm saying is...

333
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:10,795
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

334
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:14,575
The only problem is right now, we
don't have a way to navigate it.

335
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,944
But what if we did?

336
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:19,694
I can't stop thinking about it. What
if we could somehow control the chaos,

337
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:23,272
and we could navigate it? What if
there was a way that we can enter

338
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:25,787
the quantum realm at a certain
point in time but then

339
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:29,249
exit the quantum realm at
another point in time? Like...

340
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:31,832
Like before Thanos.

341
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:34,239
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?

342
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:37,342
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

343
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,242
It's more like a...

344
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:44,021
Yeah, like a time machine. I
know. It's crazy. It's crazy.

345
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:47,769
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...

346
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:51,456
- Some wa... It's crazy.
- Scott..

347
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:55,824
I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,
nothing sounds crazy anymore.

348
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,288
So who do we talk to about this?

349
00:33:16,115 --> 00:33:17,255
Chow-time!

350
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:20,982
Morgoona.

351
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:27,411
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?

352
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:30,504
- Define lunch or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

353
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,727
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

354
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:35,870
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.

355
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:41,519
There you go. Are you
thinking about lunch?

356
00:33:41,748 --> 00:33:43,905
Want a handful of crickets?

357
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,812
- No.
- That's what you want.

358
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:49,253
- How did you find this?
- Garage.

359
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:50,062
Really?

360
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:52,447
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

361
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,643
I found it, though.

362
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,160
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.

363
00:33:59,193 --> 00:34:02,303
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.

364
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:25,936
Now, we know what
it sounds like...

365
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:27,963
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...

366
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:30,377
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,

367
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,412
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?

368
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:34,569
Thank you.

369
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:37,266
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

370
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,292
- I did.
- No.

371
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,327
You accidentally survived.
It's a...

372
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:42,884
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

373
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:44,720
And now you wanna pull a...

374
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,344
What do you call it?

375
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:50,775
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.

376
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:53,218
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?

377
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:55,735
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?

378
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,208
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.

379
00:34:59,233 --> 00:35:01,740
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

380
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,908
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

381
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,174
I don't believe we would.

382
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:08,613
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.

383
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:11,910
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,

384
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:16,234
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.

385
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:19,356
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

386
00:35:19,381 --> 00:35:22,390
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

387
00:35:22,617 --> 00:35:26,565
That means no talking to our past
selves, no betting on sporting events...

388
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:29,129
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

389
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:31,755
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to

390
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,882
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?

391
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:38,906
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.

392
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,203
'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's
not how quantum physics works.

393
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:43,457
Tony...

394
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,350
We have to take a stand.

395
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:50,501
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.

396
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:55,707
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.

397
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:00,797
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.

398
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,274
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.

399
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:06,684
And you're telling me
that you won't even...

400
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:08,863
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.

401
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:12,162
Got a kid.

402
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:16,259
Mommy told me to
come and save you.

403
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,932
Good job. I'm saved.

404
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,676
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.

405
00:36:21,692 --> 00:36:24,607
Anything else. Honestly, happy
to see you guys, it was...

406
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:27,797
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.

407
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:30,305
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

408
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:32,885
But this is a second chance.

409
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:35,622
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

410
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:37,839
I can't roll the dice again.

411
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:42,034
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

412
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,360
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.

413
00:36:47,578 --> 00:36:49,805
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?

414
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:52,072
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?

415
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:54,004
No. I wanna do it right.

416
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:59,459
We're gonna need a
really big brain.

417
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,537
Bigger than his?

418
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,718
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating here. Try some of that.

419
00:37:04,743 --> 00:37:05,977
Have some eggs.

420
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:07,525
I'm so confused.

421
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:10,203
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...

422
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:13,111
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.

423
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:16,544
I'm kidding! I know.
It's crazy.

424
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:20,942
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?

425
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:23,632
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.

426
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:27,010
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.

427
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:31,355
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.

428
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,226
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.

429
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:37,662
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's

430
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:40,125
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.

431
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,783
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.

432
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:48,908
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.

433
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:52,824
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.

434
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:55,110
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?

435
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:58,746
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.

436
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,521
Come on, step on
up. You mind?

437
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,083
- Oh. Yeah.
- Thanks.

438
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,869
- Say "green."
- Green.

439
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:07,549
Greeeen.

440
00:38:07,574 --> 00:38:10,279
- Did you get that?
- That's good.

441
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:13,617
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

442
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:18,047
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

443
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:20,260
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...

444
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,809
You want to take a
picture with him, right?

445
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,952
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.

446
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:27,938
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.

447
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,847
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

448
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:32,224
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.

449
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:34,972
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the goddamn phone.

450
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,808
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

451
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,111
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.

452
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:41,293
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.

453
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:43,810
- Dab.
- Bruce.

454
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:46,539
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.

455
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:49,533
- About we were saying...
- Right.

456
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:54,150
The whole time travel do-over?

457
00:38:55,564 --> 00:38:58,747
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

458
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:01,545
Well, you pulled this off.

459
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:05,376
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

460
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:41,449
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.

461
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:45,605
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.

462
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:50,233
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?

463
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:51,891
Processing...

464
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:59,393
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.

465
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:02,116
- That'll take a second.
- Just a moment.

466
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:06,205
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

467
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,040
Model rendered.

468
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,346
Shit!

469
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:22,917
Shit!

470
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:28,769
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?

471
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:30,629
- Shit.
- No. We don't say that.

472
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:33,897
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.

473
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:35,039
Why you up?

474
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:37,691
'Cause I got some important shit
going on here. What do you think?

475
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:40,855
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

476
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,867
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.

477
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:49,739
That's extortion.
What kind you want?

478
00:40:49,764 --> 00:40:53,617
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...

479
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:56,494
my mind.

480
00:40:57,316 --> 00:41:00,489
You done? Yeah?
Now you are.

481
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,932
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.

482
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,801
A story.

483
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:13,512
Once upon a time, Mongoona
went to bed. The end.

484
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:14,978
That is a horrible story.

485
00:41:15,003 --> 00:41:17,254
Come on, that's your
favorite story.

486
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:18,807
I love you tons.

487
00:41:20,528 --> 00:41:23,052
I love you 3,000.

488
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Wow.

489
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:35,126
3,000. That's crazy.

490
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:38,498
Go to bed. Or I'll
sell all your toys.

491
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,028
Night-night.

492
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:44,476
Not that it's a competition,
but she loves me 3,000.

493
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:45,249
Does she now?

494
00:41:45,274 --> 00:41:49,174
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

495
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:58,857
- What you reading?
- Just a book on composting.

496
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:01,100
What's new with composting?

497
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,001
- Just...
- I figured it out...

498
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,479
by the way.

499
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,261
You know, just so we're talking
about the same thing...

500
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,091
Time travel.

501
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:14,225
What?

502
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:18,690
Wow.

503
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:21,989
That's...

504
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:26,492
Amazing, and... terrifying.

505
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:27,735
That's right.

506
00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:39,644
- I got really lucky.
- Yeah. I know.

507
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:42,841
- A lot of people didn't.
- No, I can't help everybody.

508
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:47,082
- It sorta seems like you can.
- Not if I stop.

509
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,827
I can put a pin in it
right now, and stop.

510
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:53,453
Tony...

511
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:59,074
trying to get you to stop has been one
of the few failures of my entire life.

512
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:08,567
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked
box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...

513
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:11,162
...go to bed.

514
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:19,405
But would you be able to rest?

515
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:26,994
Okay, here we go. Time
travel test number one.

516
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:31,912
Scott, fire up the, uhh...
The van thing.

517
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:37,250
Breakers are set. Emergency
generators are on standby.

518
00:43:37,275 --> 00:43:42,195
Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't
wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.

519
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:44,610
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

520
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:46,696
You can't say things like that.

521
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:49,824
Just... it was,
just a bad joke.

522
00:43:51,177 --> 00:43:53,451
- You were kidding, right?
- I have no idea.

523
00:43:53,528 --> 00:43:57,671
We're talking about time travel here.
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

524
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,844
We're good! Get your helmet on.

525
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:04,284
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week, but you'll walk

526
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,310
around for an hour, then bring
you back in 10 seconds.

527
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,937
- Makes sense?
- Perfectly not confusing.

528
00:44:09,962 --> 00:44:12,565
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

529
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:17,320
You're right. I do,
Captain America.

530
00:44:18,977 --> 00:44:24,824
On the count of three.
3.. 2.. 1..

531
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,865
Guys? This doesn't feel right.

532
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,874
- What's going on? Hold on.
- Who is that?

533
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:35,908
- Is that Scott?
- Yes, it's Scott!

534
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:40,696
Ooh! My back!

535
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,707
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it!

536
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:53,649
It's a baby.

537
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:55,261
- It's Scott.
- As a baby!

538
00:44:55,286 --> 00:44:56,988
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

539
00:44:57,013 --> 00:44:59,309
When I say kill the
power, kill the power.

540
00:45:00,521 --> 00:45:02,592
And... kill it!

541
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:08,044
Somebody peed my pants.

542
00:45:08,091 --> 00:45:09,325
Oh, thank God.

543
00:45:09,411 --> 00:45:12,703
But, I don't know if it was
"baby" me or "old" me.

544
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,991
Or, just "me" me.

545
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,961
Time travel!

546
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,488
What?

547
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:28,630
I see this as an absolute win.

548
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,064
Why the long face?

549
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:17,057
Let me guess. He
turned into a baby.

550
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:20,272
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

551
00:46:20,335 --> 00:46:22,297
That's the EPR paradox.

552
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:26,144
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you
might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

553
00:46:26,169 --> 00:46:29,122
It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody
could cautioned you against it.

554
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:31,555
- You did.
- Oh, did I?

555
00:46:32,278 --> 00:46:36,859
Thank God, I'm here.
Regardless, I fixed it.

556
00:46:36,884 --> 00:46:39,306
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

557
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:43,396
I just want peace.

558
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:47,230
Turns out, resentment is
corrosive, and I hate it.

559
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:49,066
Me, too.

560
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:52,166
We got a shot at getting
these stones, but I

561
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:53,943
gotta tell you my
priority is to bring back

562
00:46:53,973 --> 00:46:56,363
what we lost?
I hope, yes.

563
00:46:56,388 --> 00:46:59,257
Keep what I found? I
have to, at all costs.

564
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:04,331
And, maybe not die
trying will be nice.

565
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,623
Sounds like a deal.

566
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:35,735
- Tony, I don't know...
- Why? He made it for you.

567
00:47:36,384 --> 00:47:40,793
Plus, honestly I have to get it out the
garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

568
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:46,904
Thank you, Tony.

569
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:51,797
Will you keep that a little quiet?
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

570
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:58,401
- We are getting, the whole team, yeah?
- We're working on that right now.

571
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:21,741
- Hey, humie! Where's big green?
- Kitchen. I think.

572
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:27,589
- That's awesome.
- Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

573
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:30,208
There's an idiot in
the landing zone.

574
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:31,730
Oh, God!

575
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:34,816
What's up, regular-sized man?

576
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:29,630
Kind of a step down from a golden palace
with some magic hammers and whatnot.

577
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:32,148
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.
First, they've lost Asgard,

578
00:49:32,173 --> 00:49:35,220
then half the people. They're
probably just happy to have a home.

579
00:49:35,245 --> 00:49:37,209
You shouldn't have come!

580
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:39,703
Valkyrie!

581
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,582
Great to see you, Angry Girl.

582
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,013
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

583
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,639
- This is Rocket.
- How you doin'?

584
00:49:50,703 --> 00:49:52,829
- He won't see you.
- That bad, huh?

585
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,898
We only see him once a month,
when he comes in for...

586
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:58,162
...supplies.

587
00:49:58,716 --> 00:50:00,900
- It's that bad.
- Yeah.

588
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:14,633
What the...

589
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,164
Woo! Something died in here.

590
00:50:20,805 --> 00:50:23,025
Hello? Thor?

591
00:50:23,494 --> 00:50:25,627
Are you here about the cable?

592
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:31,460
The Cinemax ran out two weeks ago,
and, sports were all kind of fuzzy...

593
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:33,525
Thor?

594
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,962
Boys! Oh, my God!

595
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:47,801
My God! It's so
good to see you!

596
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:50,006
Come here, you little rascal!

597
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,030
No, I'm good! I'm good.

598
00:50:52,405 --> 00:50:54,164
That's not necessary!

599
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:57,022
Hulk, you know my friends,
Miek, Korg, right?

600
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,419
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys. Long time no see.

601
00:50:59,444 --> 00:51:02,315
Beer's on the bucket. Feel
free to log on to the wi-fi.

602
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,050
No password, obviously.

603
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:09,058
Thor, he's back. That kid on the TV
just called me a dickhead again.

604
00:51:09,895 --> 00:51:13,124
- Noobmaster.
- Yeah, Noobmaster69.

605
00:51:15,759 --> 00:51:18,761
Noobmaster. Hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder?

606
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:21,833
Listen, buddy. If you don't log off
this game immediately I'm gonna fly

607
00:51:21,858 --> 00:51:24,679
over to your house, come down to
that basement you're hiding in,

608
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:27,141
rip off your arms then
shove them up your butt!

609
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:30,654
Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to
your father, you little weasel!

610
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:32,108
Thank you, Thor.

611
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:33,720
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

612
00:51:33,745 --> 00:51:35,242
Thank you very much. I will.

613
00:51:35,796 --> 00:51:37,469
So you guys want a drink?
What are you drinking?

614
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,082
We have beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

615
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:45,562
Buddy, you all right?

616
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:48,422
Yes, I'm fine! Why,
don't I look all right?

617
00:51:48,548 --> 00:51:50,596
You look like melted ice cream.

618
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:54,343
So, what's up?

619
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:58,822
We need your help. There might be
a chance we could fix everything.

620
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:02,629
What, like the cable? 'Cause that's
been driving me bananas for weeks.

621
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:04,068
Like Thanos.

622
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,849
Don't say that name.

623
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,459
Um, yeah. We don't actually
say that name in here.

624
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,304
Please take your hand off me.

625
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:40,252
Now, I know that...

626
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:44,612
guy might scare you.

627
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:49,155
Why would I be? Why would, why
would I be scared of that guy?

628
00:52:49,742 --> 00:52:52,072
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

629
00:52:52,814 --> 00:52:55,253
Anyone else here
killed that guy?

630
00:52:58,196 --> 00:53:01,291
Nope. Didn't think so.

631
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:06,029
Korg, why don't you, tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off.

632
00:53:06,054 --> 00:53:07,820
Umm... Stormbreaker?

633
00:53:07,845 --> 00:53:10,368
Now, who's swinging
Stormbreaker?

634
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:17,117
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?
I've been there myself.

635
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:19,368
You wanna know who
helped me out of it?

636
00:53:19,392 --> 00:53:22,346
I don't know.
Is it... Natasha?

637
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,713
It was you.

638
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,099
You helped me.

639
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:32,423
Why don't you ask the,
Asgardians down there,

640
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:34,980
how much my help was worth.

641
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,829
The ones that are left, anyway.

642
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,862
I think we can bring them back.

643
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,582
Stop. Just, stop...

644
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:53,534
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in
my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and

645
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:56,375
and saved. But I'm fine, okay?
We're fine, aren't we?

646
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,649
Nah, all good here, mate!

647
00:53:57,674 --> 00:53:59,533
So, whatever it is that
you're offering, we're

648
00:53:59,558 --> 00:54:01,910
not into it, don't care,
couldn't care less.

649
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:03,066
Goodbye.

650
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,726
We need you, pal.

651
00:54:17,514 --> 00:54:19,500
There's beer on the ship.

652
00:54:23,582 --> 00:54:24,738
What kind?

653
00:56:11,253 --> 00:56:12,723
What I want...

654
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:15,057
You can't give me.

655
00:56:38,417 --> 00:56:40,097
You shouldn't be here.

656
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,655
Neither should you.

657
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,356
I've got a job to do.

658
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,037
Is that what you're
calling this?

659
00:56:55,648 --> 00:56:58,852
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

660
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,564
We found something.

661
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:08,895
A chance, maybe...

662
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:13,391
Don't.

663
00:57:14,462 --> 00:57:15,830
Don't what?

664
00:57:18,629 --> 00:57:20,427
Don't give me hope.

665
00:57:23,746 --> 00:57:26,412
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

666
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:51,394
Drifting left. On the
side there, Lebowski.

667
00:57:54,423 --> 00:57:56,614
- Ratchet, how's it going?
- It's Rocket.

668
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,734
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

669
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:00,789
Yup.

670
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:06,809
Time travel suit? Not bad.

671
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:08,880
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy!

672
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:11,670
- I'm being very careful.
- No, you're being very Hulky.

673
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:14,255
- I'm being careful.
- These are Pym particles, all right?

674
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,033
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

675
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:19,113
This is what we have. We're
not making any more.

676
00:58:19,138 --> 00:58:20,884
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

677
00:58:20,923 --> 00:58:23,289
We've got enough for
one round trip, each.

678
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:27,685
That's it. No do-overs.
Plus, two test runs.

679
00:58:31,826 --> 00:58:33,108
One test run.

680
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:35,704
All right. I'm not
ready for this.

681
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:36,944
I'm game.

682
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,457
I'll do it.

683
00:58:41,496 --> 00:58:43,779
Clint, now you're gonna feel
a little discombobulated

684
00:58:43,804 --> 00:58:45,538
from the chronoshift.
Don't worry about it.

685
00:58:45,546 --> 00:58:46,873
Wait a second, let me
ask you something.

686
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,720
If we can do this, you know, go
back in time, why don't we just

687
00:58:49,745 --> 00:58:52,933
find baby Thanos, you know?
And...

688
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,484
- First of all, that's horrible.
- It's Thanos.

689
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:03,051
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

690
00:59:03,076 --> 00:59:05,945
Look, we go back, we get the
stones before Thanos gets them...

691
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:08,870
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

692
00:59:08,895 --> 00:59:10,753
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

693
00:59:10,778 --> 00:59:13,192
- Well, that's what I heard.
- What? By who? Who told you that?

694
00:59:13,225 --> 00:59:16,039
Star Trek, Terminator,
TimeCop, Time After Time,

695
00:59:16,064 --> 00:59:17,389
- Quantum Leap.
- A Wrinkle in Time,

696
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:19,914
- Somewhere in Time,
- Hot Tub Time Machine.

697
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:24,199
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically,
any movie that deals with time travel.

698
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:26,069
Die Hard? No, it's not...

699
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:27,133
This is known.

700
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:29,502
I don't know why everyone believes
that, but that isn't true.

701
00:59:29,556 --> 00:59:33,847
Think about it: If you travel to the
past, that past becomes your future.

702
00:59:33,997 --> 00:59:37,220
And your former present
becomes the past.

703
00:59:37,306 --> 00:59:40,128
Which can't now be changed
by your new future...

704
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:41,253
Exactly.

705
00:59:41,573 --> 00:59:44,621
So Back to the Future's
a bunch of bullshit?

706
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:55,153
All right, Clint. We're
going in 3.. 2.. 1...

707
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:08,768
Cooper?

708
01:01:08,972 --> 01:01:11,810
- Where are my headphones?
- Lila?

709
01:01:17,117 --> 01:01:18,887
Lila! No!

710
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:24,968
Dad?

711
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:29,955
Dad?

712
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:42,991
Hey, hey. Look at
me. You okay?

713
01:01:43,843 --> 01:01:44,844
Yeah.

714
01:01:47,743 --> 01:01:49,042
It worked.

715
01:01:50,695 --> 01:01:51,977
It worked.

716
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,167
Okay, so the "how" works.

717
01:01:57,676 --> 01:02:01,184
Now we gotta figure out the
"when," and the "where."

718
01:02:01,894 --> 01:02:03,629
Almost everyone in this
room has had an encounter

719
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:05,482
with at least one of the
six Infinity Stones.

720
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:07,287
Well, I'd substitute the
word 'encounter' for 'damn

721
01:02:07,312 --> 01:02:09,774
near have been killed by one
of the six Infinity Stones.'

722
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:13,393
I haven't. I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.

723
01:02:13,518 --> 01:02:18,513
Regardless, we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round trip each,

724
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,922
and these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

725
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:26,119
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

726
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:29,872
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

727
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:33,139
So. Let's start
with the Aether.

728
01:02:33,303 --> 01:02:35,241
Thor, what do you know?

729
01:02:40,002 --> 01:02:41,221
Is he asleep?

730
01:02:41,444 --> 01:02:42,444
No, no.

731
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,158
Pretty sure he's dead.

732
01:02:46,961 --> 01:02:49,298
Where to start? Umm...

733
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:53,278
The Aether, first,
is not a stone.

734
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:56,851
Someone's called it a stone before.
Ahem...

735
01:02:56,913 --> 01:03:00,618
It's more of a... an angry
sludge, sort of thing. So...

736
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,786
Someone's gonna need to amend
that, and stop saying that.

737
01:03:03,993 --> 01:03:05,927
Here's an interesting
story, though.

738
01:03:06,008 --> 01:03:08,458
About the Aether. My
grandfather, many years

739
01:03:08,483 --> 01:03:12,488
ago, had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

740
01:03:14,516 --> 01:03:17,378
Scary beings. So
Jane, actually...

741
01:03:17,643 --> 01:03:23,443
Oh, there she is. That's Jane...
She's... an old flame of mine.

742
01:03:24,043 --> 01:03:27,451
She... she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

743
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,813
and then the Aether stuck
itself inside her.

744
01:03:30,834 --> 01:03:34,039
And, she became very, very sick.
So I had to take her to

745
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:37,800
Asgard, which is where I'm from.
And we had to try and fix her.

746
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:43,476
We were dating at the time, you see. I
got to introduce her to my Mother...

747
01:03:44,893 --> 01:03:47,129
who's dead, and umm...

748
01:03:48,142 --> 01:03:51,942
Oh, you know. Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...

749
01:03:52,277 --> 01:03:54,818
These things happen though, you know.
Nothing lasts forever.

750
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:56,075
- The only thing that...
- Why don't you come sit down.

751
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,502
I'm not done yet. The only thing that
is permanent in life, is impermanence.

752
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:02,370
Awesome.

753
01:04:02,395 --> 01:04:03,566
Eggs? Breakfast?

754
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:05,531
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

755
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:08,445
Quill said he stole the
Power Stone from Morag.

756
01:04:08,688 --> 01:04:12,002
- Is that a person?
- Morag's a planet.

757
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,977
Quill was a person.

758
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:17,150
Like a planet? Like
in outer space?

759
01:04:17,276 --> 01:04:21,083
Oh, look. It's like a little
puppy, all happy and everything.

760
01:04:21,215 --> 01:04:24,741
Do you wanna go to space? You
wanna go to space, puppy?

761
01:04:24,806 --> 01:04:26,747
I'll take you to space.

762
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,915
- Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
- What is Vormir?

763
01:04:31,486 --> 01:04:35,981
A dominion of death, at the very
center of Celestial existence.

764
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:41,167
It's where... Thanos
murdered my sister.

765
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:48,583
Noted.

766
01:04:50,244 --> 01:04:52,346
- That Time Stone guy...
- Doctor Strange.

767
01:04:52,386 --> 01:04:53,933
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

768
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:57,600
- Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat.
- Nice place in the village, though.

769
01:04:57,632 --> 01:05:00,084
- Yeah. Sullivan Street.
- Hmm... Bleecker.

770
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:01,719
Wait, he lived in New York?

771
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,963
- No. He lived in Toronto.
- Yeah, not Bleecker. It's Sullivan.

772
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:10,291
Guys, if you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

773
01:05:12,504 --> 01:05:13,942
Shut the front door!

774
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:19,429
All right. We have a plan.

775
01:05:19,507 --> 01:05:24,326
Six stones, three
teams, one shot.

776
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:35,578
Five years ago, we lost.

777
01:05:36,587 --> 01:05:37,951
All of us.

778
01:05:39,855 --> 01:05:40,903
We lost friends...

779
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,627
We lost family...

780
01:05:45,777 --> 01:05:47,590
We lost a part of ourselves.

781
01:05:48,818 --> 01:05:51,280
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

782
01:05:52,498 --> 01:05:55,679
You know your teams, you
know your missions.

783
01:05:56,094 --> 01:05:58,924
Get the stones, get them back.

784
01:05:58,979 --> 01:06:03,341
One round trip each. No mistakes.
No do-overs.

785
01:06:03,764 --> 01:06:05,981
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

786
01:06:06,035 --> 01:06:08,724
But it doesn't mean we
should know what to expect.

787
01:06:08,943 --> 01:06:12,148
Be careful. Look out
for each other.

788
01:06:13,228 --> 01:06:17,379
This is the fight of our lives.
And we're gonna win.

789
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:21,293
Whatever it takes.

790
01:06:23,805 --> 01:06:25,103
Good luck.

791
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:27,574
- He's pretty good at that.
- Right?

792
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:30,591
All right. You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, jelly green.

793
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:33,412
Tractors engaged.

794
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,827
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

795
01:06:35,852 --> 01:06:37,845
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay.

796
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:41,630
- I'll do my best.
- As promises go, that was pretty lame.

797
01:06:44,189 --> 01:06:45,672
See you in a minute.

798
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:43,241
All right, we all have our assignments.
Two stones uptown, one stone, down.

799
01:07:43,663 --> 01:07:46,047
Stay low. Keep an
eye on the clock.

800
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:03,225
Maybe smash a few
things along the way.

801
01:08:04,016 --> 01:08:06,295
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

802
01:08:33,647 --> 01:08:37,102
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

803
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:44,262
I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

804
01:08:45,552 --> 01:08:48,476
You're about... five
years too early.

805
01:08:48,866 --> 01:08:53,205
Stephen Strange is currently performing
surgery about twenty blocks that way.

806
01:08:54,507 --> 01:08:56,277
What do you want from him?

807
01:08:56,648 --> 01:08:58,180
That, actually.

808
01:08:58,469 --> 01:08:59,470
Ah.

809
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:03,981
- I'm afraid not.
- Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

810
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:06,435
- You don't wanna do this.
- You're right. I don't.

811
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,696
But I need that stone, and
I don't have time to...

812
01:09:17,723 --> 01:09:19,701
Let's start over, shall we?

813
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,170
That's Jane.

814
01:09:41,812 --> 01:09:42,891
All right.

815
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:45,871
Here's the deal, Tubby:

816
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,971
You're gonna charm her and I'm
gonna poke her with this thing

817
01:09:47,996 --> 01:09:51,227
and extract the Reality Stone
and get gone, lickety-split.

818
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:55,582
I'll be right back, okay? There's a
wine cellar, that's just down there.

819
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:58,404
My father used to fish
with a barrel of ale.

820
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:02,665
- I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...
- Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

821
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:23,372
Who's the fancy broad?

822
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:27,900
It's my Mother.
She dies today.

823
01:10:28,986 --> 01:10:30,854
Oh. That's today?

824
01:10:36,994 --> 01:10:40,058
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

825
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:43,420
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't
have come. This was a bad idea.

826
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,765
- Come here.
- No, no, no. I'm having...

827
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:49,251
- I'm having a panic attack.
- Come here. Right here.

828
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:53,668
You think you're the only one who lost
people? What do you think we're doing here?

829
01:10:53,693 --> 01:10:55,865
I lost the only
family I ever had.

830
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:00,072
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick
with the antenna, all gone.

831
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:05,122
Now, I get you miss your Mom.
But she's gone. Really gone.

832
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:08,265
And there are plenty of people
who are only kinda gone.

833
01:11:08,304 --> 01:11:10,118
But you can help them.

834
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:13,928
So is it too much to ask that you
brush the crumbs outta your beard,

835
01:11:13,953 --> 01:11:17,909
make schmoopy talk to Pretty
Pants, and when she's not looking,

836
01:11:18,136 --> 01:11:22,044
suck out the Infinity Stone and
help me get my family back?

837
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,981
Okay.

838
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:27,170
- Are you crying?
- No...

839
01:11:29,316 --> 01:11:31,675
Yes! I feel like I'm losing it.

840
01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:34,542
Get it together!
You can do this.

841
01:11:34,943 --> 01:11:36,600
You can do this.

842
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:40,947
All right?

843
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,348
- Yes, I can.
- Good.

844
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,232
I can do this.

845
01:11:48,254 --> 01:11:49,677
I can't do this.

846
01:11:49,756 --> 01:11:53,343
Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone.
This is our shot.

847
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,392
Thor?

848
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:56,198
Thor!

849
01:12:06,304 --> 01:12:07,961
Alright. Bring it down low.

850
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:10,531
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

851
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:16,703
Hey, can we hurry it up?

852
01:12:16,728 --> 01:12:18,935
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

853
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,824
All that, is really helpful.

854
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:24,830
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

855
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:27,355
Take that stone and come back.
No messing around.

856
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:29,607
- Hey.
- You got this.

857
01:12:29,632 --> 01:12:31,003
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

858
01:12:31,028 --> 01:12:32,774
See you back.

859
01:12:32,799 --> 01:12:34,723
You guys watch each other's six.

860
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:35,749
Yeah.

861
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:47,030
The coordinates for
Vormir are laid in.

862
01:12:47,818 --> 01:12:50,327
All they have to do
is not fall out.

863
01:12:55,734 --> 01:12:58,368
We're a long way from Budapest.

864
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,041
Okay, so, uhh...

865
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:08,953
We just wait around for this
Quill guy to show up and

866
01:13:08,978 --> 01:13:11,373
then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

867
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:13,460
Let's take cover.

868
01:13:14,414 --> 01:13:17,547
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

869
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:18,987
Wait a minute, what are
you talking about right

870
01:13:19,012 --> 01:13:20,956
now? Who else is looking
for these stones?

871
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,559
My father, my sister...

872
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:30,025
- and me.
- And you?

873
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:33,665
Where are you right now?

874
01:14:02,245 --> 01:14:05,513
- You're welcome.
- I didn't ask for your help.

875
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,987
And yet, you always need it.

876
01:14:11,955 --> 01:14:13,073
Get up.

877
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:15,519
- Father wants us back on the ship.
- Why?

878
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:18,060
He's found an Infinity Stone.

879
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:25,503
- Where?
- On a planet called Morag.

880
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:29,158
Father's plan is
finally in motion.

881
01:14:29,183 --> 01:14:32,544
- One stone isn't six, Nebula.
- It's a start.

882
01:14:32,705 --> 01:14:35,214
If he gets all of them...

883
01:14:47,163 --> 01:14:50,884
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

884
01:14:50,909 --> 01:14:54,269
- He won't like that.
- His alternative is death, then.

885
01:14:55,975 --> 01:15:00,869
Ronan's obsession
clouds his judgment.

886
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:07,217
We will not fail you, Father.

887
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,149
No, you won't.

888
01:15:12,684 --> 01:15:14,012
I swear...

889
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:17,687
I will make you proud.

890
01:15:25,806 --> 01:15:28,993
We just, wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,

891
01:15:29,018 --> 01:15:31,614
and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

892
01:15:31,998 --> 01:15:33,475
Let's take cover.

893
01:15:34,374 --> 01:15:37,915
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

894
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:41,988
- Who was that?
- I don't know...

895
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:45,130
My head is splitting...
I don't know...

896
01:15:46,318 --> 01:15:49,653
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

897
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:01,288
Bring her to my ship.

898
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,830
Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.

899
01:16:11,855 --> 01:16:14,442
Got it. I'm approaching
the elevator now.

900
01:16:20,365 --> 01:16:22,366
If it's all the same to you...

901
01:16:24,507 --> 01:16:26,176
I'll have that drink now.

902
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:30,871
All right. Good one. No standing around,
I'm closing up this door for later.

903
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:32,856
By the way, feel
free to clean up.

904
01:16:32,903 --> 01:16:35,514
Ugh, Mr. Rogers. I almost
forgot that that suit

905
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,000
- did nothing for your ass.
- No one asked you to look, Tony.

906
01:16:39,059 --> 01:16:41,068
- It's ridiculous.
- I think you look great, Cap.

907
01:16:41,093 --> 01:16:43,952
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

908
01:16:43,977 --> 01:16:48,007
- Who gets the... magic wand?
- STRIKE team's coming to secure it.

909
01:16:58,157 --> 01:17:00,071
We can take that off your hands.

910
01:17:00,173 --> 01:17:01,477
By all means.

911
01:17:03,223 --> 01:17:06,819
- Careful with that thing!
- Unless you want your mind erased.

912
01:17:06,844 --> 01:17:09,016
- Not in a fun way.
- We promise to be careful.

913
01:17:09,051 --> 01:17:11,873
- Who are these guys?
- They are SHIELD...

914
01:17:11,912 --> 01:17:14,773
Well, actually Hydra. But,
we didn't know that yet.

915
01:17:14,823 --> 01:17:18,810
Seriously, you didn't? I mean...
they look like bad guys.

916
01:17:18,857 --> 01:17:20,711
You're small, but
you're talking loud.

917
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:22,350
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.

918
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:24,503
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue!

919
01:17:24,528 --> 01:17:27,299
I mean, honestly! How do
you think you'll be...

920
01:17:27,324 --> 01:17:28,632
Shut up.

921
01:17:29,976 --> 01:17:32,884
All right, you're up, little buddy.
There's our stone.

922
01:17:33,056 --> 01:17:35,550
Alright. Flick me.

923
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:52,296
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
- Hey! Buddy.

924
01:17:52,331 --> 01:17:54,730
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

925
01:17:54,755 --> 01:17:57,592
- Take the stairs!
- Yeah. Stop. Stop!

926
01:18:00,386 --> 01:18:03,498
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs!

927
01:18:06,836 --> 01:18:11,604
All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the
elevator just passing the 80th floor.

928
01:18:12,206 --> 01:18:13,223
On it.

929
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:16,396
- Head to the lobby.
- Alright. I'll see you there.

930
01:18:16,421 --> 01:18:19,398
Evidence secure. We're
en route to Dr. List.

931
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:23,331
No. No hitches at all, Mr.
Secretary.

932
01:18:28,498 --> 01:18:31,477
Captain. I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue?

933
01:18:31,563 --> 01:18:33,212
Change of plans.

934
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:37,816
Hey, Cap.

935
01:18:39,165 --> 01:18:40,404
Rumlow.

936
01:18:46,944 --> 01:18:50,977
I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm
gonna be running point on the scepter.

937
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:55,901
Sir? I don't understand.

938
01:18:57,849 --> 01:18:59,967
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

939
01:18:59,992 --> 01:19:01,242
Sorry, Cap.

940
01:19:01,639 --> 01:19:03,561
I can't give you the scepter.

941
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:08,033
- I'm gonna have to call the Director.
- That's okay. Trust me.

942
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:13,097
Hail Hydra.

943
01:19:27,088 --> 01:19:29,184
So many stairs!

944
01:19:40,689 --> 01:19:43,472
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

945
01:19:43,496 --> 01:19:45,990
- It is go-time.
- Bombs away.

946
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,439
Is, is that Axe body spray?

947
01:19:55,464 --> 01:19:58,239
Yeah, I had a can just
for emergencies. Relax.

948
01:19:58,309 --> 01:20:02,382
- Can we focus, please?
- I'm going inside you. Now.

949
01:20:07,735 --> 01:20:09,482
May I ask you
where you're going?

950
01:20:09,507 --> 01:20:12,013
To lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?

951
01:20:12,038 --> 01:20:15,674
Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one
of the folks behind Nick Fury.

952
01:20:15,699 --> 01:20:17,027
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

953
01:20:17,052 --> 01:20:19,669
I'm gonna have to ask you to
turn that prisoner over to me.

954
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,796
- Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
- Oh, he's gonna answer to us.

955
01:20:22,822 --> 01:20:25,548
Odin can have what's left. And
I'm gonna need that case.

956
01:20:25,705 --> 01:20:27,707
That's been SHIELD property
for over 70 years.

957
01:20:27,732 --> 01:20:28,950
Hand over the case, Stark.

958
01:20:28,975 --> 01:20:31,617
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things
are getting dicey up here. Let's go.

959
01:20:31,642 --> 01:20:33,811
I'm not gonna argue who's got the
higher authority here, all right?

960
01:20:33,836 --> 01:20:35,228
You promise me you won't die?

961
01:20:35,253 --> 01:20:38,236
You're only giving me a
mild cardiac dysrythmia.

962
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:39,995
That doesn't sound mild.

963
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:40,639
I need the case.

964
01:20:40,664 --> 01:20:42,499
I know you got a lotta pull.
I'm just saying...

965
01:20:42,524 --> 01:20:44,314
Okay. Then give
me the case.

966
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:47,238
Do it, Lang!

967
01:20:47,261 --> 01:20:49,990
- Get your hands off!
- Window's closing. Pull my pin!

968
01:20:50,153 --> 01:20:51,272
Here goes!

969
01:20:54,532 --> 01:20:56,408
- Stark?
- Stark!

970
01:20:56,447 --> 01:20:58,455
Look, he's convulsing.
Give him air!

971
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,489
- Medic!
- Medic!

972
01:21:00,747 --> 01:21:02,732
You got some help!

973
01:21:03,976 --> 01:21:06,563
Stark, you... your
chest machine?

974
01:21:08,345 --> 01:21:09,596
Breathe! Breathe!

975
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:17,830
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

976
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:25,366
No stairs!

977
01:21:32,923 --> 01:21:34,433
You'll be fine, Stark.
Stay with us!

978
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,497
I'll try something, okay? I have
no idea if it's gonna work.

979
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:39,733
Yes!

980
01:21:39,758 --> 01:21:42,016
That worked a treat.
That was so crazy!

981
01:21:42,032 --> 01:21:44,049
I had no idea if
that was gonna work.

982
01:21:44,074 --> 01:21:45,916
- The case...
- The case. It's, uhh...

983
01:21:45,957 --> 01:21:48,427
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

984
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:49,630
Loki!

985
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:52,766
- That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
- Oh, we blew it.

986
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:54,198
Loki!?

987
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:58,073
Tony, what's going on?

988
01:21:58,558 --> 01:22:00,708
Tell me you found that cube.

989
01:22:02,608 --> 01:22:04,818
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

990
01:22:08,518 --> 01:22:10,919
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

991
01:22:11,029 --> 01:22:12,342
I'm not Loki.

992
01:22:15,713 --> 01:22:17,698
And I don't wanna hurt you.

993
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,532
I can do this all day.

994
01:22:27,557 --> 01:22:29,941
Yeah, I know. I know.

995
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:04,515
Where did you get this?

996
01:23:14,901 --> 01:23:18,469
Bucky... is... alive!

997
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,221
What?

998
01:23:37,164 --> 01:23:39,259
That is America's ass.

999
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:46,592
- Please, please!
- I'm sorry. I can't help you, Bruce.

1000
01:23:47,492 --> 01:23:51,119
If I give up the Time Stone to help
your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1001
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:56,021
With all due respect, I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

1002
01:24:01,505 --> 01:24:05,647
The Infinity Stones create what you
experience as the flow of time.

1003
01:24:05,878 --> 01:24:09,600
Remove one of the stones,
and that flow splits.

1004
01:24:09,928 --> 01:24:14,994
Now this may benefit your reality.
But my new one, not so much.

1005
01:24:15,113 --> 01:24:20,358
In this new branched reality, without our
chief weapon against the forces of darkness,

1006
01:24:20,581 --> 01:24:24,459
our world will be overrun.
Millions will suffer.

1007
01:24:24,484 --> 01:24:28,580
So, tell me, doctor, can your
science prevent all that?

1008
01:24:28,704 --> 01:24:32,002
No. But we can erase it.

1009
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:36,004
Because once we're done with the stones, we
can return each one into its own time line

1010
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:40,390
at the moment it was taken.
So, chronologically...

1011
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:46,363
In that reality...
it never left.

1012
01:24:48,726 --> 01:24:51,892
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1013
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:58,227
In order to return the
stones, you have to survive.

1014
01:24:58,274 --> 01:25:01,089
We will. I will.
I promise.

1015
01:25:01,747 --> 01:25:04,500
I can't risk this
reality on a promise.

1016
01:25:04,836 --> 01:25:09,620
It's the duty, of the Sorcerer
Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

1017
01:25:10,356 --> 01:25:13,216
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1018
01:25:14,014 --> 01:25:16,233
- What did you say?
- Strange. He gave it away.

1019
01:25:16,272 --> 01:25:18,056
He gave it to Thanos.

1020
01:25:18,336 --> 01:25:20,228
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1021
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:27,158
- Why?
- I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.

1022
01:25:37,556 --> 01:25:38,838
Or I did.

1023
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,729
Strange was meant to
be the best of us.

1024
01:26:01,753 --> 01:26:04,622
So he must've done
it for a reason.

1025
01:26:05,019 --> 01:26:07,364
I fear you might be right.

1026
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:12,711
Thank you.

1027
01:26:18,885 --> 01:26:20,801
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1028
01:26:22,653 --> 01:26:24,012
We all are.

1029
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:45,623
Run diagnostics.

1030
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,289
Show me her memory file.

1031
01:26:50,024 --> 01:26:52,549
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1032
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:55,981
It was a memory, but not hers.

1033
01:26:56,802 --> 01:26:59,913
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.

1034
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:01,880
Another Nebula.

1035
01:27:03,806 --> 01:27:05,096
Impossible.

1036
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:10,959
This duplicate carries a time stamp...
from nine years in the future.

1037
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,863
Where is this other Nebula?

1038
01:27:18,686 --> 01:27:21,453
In our solar system.
On Morag.

1039
01:27:22,369 --> 01:27:25,910
- Can you access her?
- Yes. The two are linked.

1040
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:30,358
Search the duplicate's
memories, for Infinity Stones.

1041
01:27:34,006 --> 01:27:37,157
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

1042
01:27:37,173 --> 01:27:41,182
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

1043
01:27:41,206 --> 01:27:44,020
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

1044
01:27:44,045 --> 01:27:45,381
Freeze image.

1045
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,399
Terrans.

1046
01:27:49,157 --> 01:27:50,974
Avengers.

1047
01:27:51,949 --> 01:27:56,115
Unruly wretches. What's
that reflection?

1048
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:59,326
Amplify this, Maw.

1049
01:28:01,494 --> 01:28:03,151
I don't understand.

1050
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,047
- Two Nebulas.
- No. The same Nebula.

1051
01:28:12,491 --> 01:28:14,375
From two different times.

1052
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:19,534
Set course for Morag. Scan
the duplicate's memories.

1053
01:28:20,434 --> 01:28:22,974
I want to see everything.

1054
01:28:32,694 --> 01:28:35,951
My ladies, I'll see you after.
Go on.

1055
01:28:50,532 --> 01:28:53,048
- What are you doing?
- Ahh!

1056
01:28:54,463 --> 01:28:57,106
You're better off leaving the
sneaking to your brother.

1057
01:28:57,138 --> 01:28:59,373
Yeah, I was simply just
going for a walk, and uh...

1058
01:28:59,398 --> 01:29:00,797
What are you wearing?

1059
01:29:00,822 --> 01:29:03,398
I always wear this. This
is one of my favorites.

1060
01:29:07,235 --> 01:29:08,696
What's wrong with your eye?

1061
01:29:08,721 --> 01:29:11,871
Oh, my eye. That's... you
remember the Battle of Haroquin?

1062
01:29:11,887 --> 01:29:15,219
When I got hit in the
face with a broadsword?

1063
01:29:18,678 --> 01:29:21,726
You're not the Thor I
know at all, are you?

1064
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:23,455
Yes, I am.

1065
01:29:23,683 --> 01:29:26,478
The future hasn't been
kind to you, has it?

1066
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,987
I didn't say I was
from the future.

1067
01:29:29,066 --> 01:29:31,498
I was raised by witches, boy.

1068
01:29:32,405 --> 01:29:35,586
I see with more than
eyes, and you know that.

1069
01:29:37,047 --> 01:29:39,633
Yeah, I am totally,
totally from the future!

1070
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:40,700
Yes, you are.

1071
01:29:41,362 --> 01:29:44,362
- I really need to talk to you.
- We can talk.

1072
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:10,103
His head was over there...

1073
01:30:10,815 --> 01:30:12,480
His body over there...

1074
01:30:14,334 --> 01:30:16,575
What was the point.
I was too late.

1075
01:30:17,631 --> 01:30:19,295
I was just standing there.

1076
01:30:20,531 --> 01:30:23,631
- Some idiot with an ax.
- You're no idiot.

1077
01:30:24,949 --> 01:30:29,459
You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1078
01:30:29,756 --> 01:30:32,321
- I guess, yeah.
- Idiot? No.

1079
01:30:32,438 --> 01:30:36,619
- A failure? Absolutely.
- That's a little bit harsh.

1080
01:30:36,674 --> 01:30:39,371
You do know what that makes you?

1081
01:30:39,522 --> 01:30:41,835
Just like everyone else.

1082
01:30:41,976 --> 01:30:45,017
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1083
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:48,690
Everyone fails at who they
are supposed to be, Thor.

1084
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:52,474
The measure of a
person, of a hero

1085
01:30:52,558 --> 01:30:55,919
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1086
01:31:01,101 --> 01:31:02,922
I really missed you, Mum.

1087
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:10,542
Thor! I got it!

1088
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:12,871
Get that rabbit!

1089
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:19,032
- Ma, I have to tell you something.
- No, son. You don't.

1090
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:22,261
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1091
01:31:22,293 --> 01:31:25,780
- But this is about your future.
- It's none of my business.

1092
01:31:29,055 --> 01:31:30,055
Hey.

1093
01:31:30,539 --> 01:31:32,071
You must be Mom.

1094
01:31:32,877 --> 01:31:34,822
I got the thing. Come
on, we got to move.

1095
01:31:34,847 --> 01:31:38,342
- I wish we had more time.
- This was a gift.

1096
01:31:38,396 --> 01:31:41,123
And you're going to be the
man you're meant to be.

1097
01:31:42,171 --> 01:31:45,118
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

1098
01:31:48,362 --> 01:31:50,082
And eat a salad.

1099
01:31:51,466 --> 01:31:53,311
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Goodbye.

1100
01:31:53,327 --> 01:31:56,109
- Three... two...
- No, wait!

1101
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:00,260
Wh-what am I looking at?

1102
01:32:00,285 --> 01:32:02,606
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

1103
01:32:11,413 --> 01:32:12,914
I'm still worthy.

1104
01:32:14,306 --> 01:32:15,580
Oh, boy.

1105
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:19,144
Goodbye, Mom.

1106
01:32:58,313 --> 01:32:59,930
So he's an idiot?

1107
01:33:11,204 --> 01:33:12,391
What's that?

1108
01:33:12,432 --> 01:33:14,172
The tool of a thief.

1109
01:33:22,148 --> 01:33:23,682
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

1110
01:33:24,152 --> 01:33:27,859
This is the part where spikes come out,
with skeletons on the end and everything...

1111
01:33:27,884 --> 01:33:28,797
What are you talking about?

1112
01:33:28,822 --> 01:33:31,450
When you break into a place called
the temple of the Power Stone,

1113
01:33:31,475 --> 01:33:35,290
there's gonna be a bunch of booby
traps... Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1114
01:34:08,459 --> 01:34:10,233
I wasn't always like this.

1115
01:34:11,137 --> 01:34:12,343
Me either.

1116
01:34:13,669 --> 01:34:15,878
But we work with
what we got, right?

1117
01:34:19,106 --> 01:34:20,332
Sync up.

1118
01:34:22,413 --> 01:34:24,829
Three.. two.. one...

1119
01:34:37,762 --> 01:34:39,239
You murdered trillions!

1120
01:34:39,264 --> 01:34:41,001
You should be grateful.

1121
01:34:42,666 --> 01:34:45,676
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

1122
01:34:46,066 --> 01:34:49,748
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

1123
01:34:49,839 --> 01:34:54,833
I used the stones to destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.

1124
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:59,055
But the work is done.
It always will be.

1125
01:35:00,235 --> 01:35:04,019
I am inevitable.

1126
01:35:04,997 --> 01:35:10,868
- What did you do to them?
- Nothing. Yet.

1127
01:35:12,116 --> 01:35:16,001
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1128
01:35:16,476 --> 01:35:20,018
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1129
01:35:20,268 --> 01:35:21,823
The stones...

1130
01:35:22,768 --> 01:35:24,567
I found them all.

1131
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:27,505
I won.

1132
01:35:28,568 --> 01:35:31,542
Tipped the cosmic
scales to balance.

1133
01:35:35,501 --> 01:35:36,908
This is your future.

1134
01:35:37,471 --> 01:35:38,956
It's my destiny.

1135
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,678
My father is many things. A
liar is not one of them.

1136
01:35:48,363 --> 01:35:50,043
Thank you, Daughter.

1137
01:35:50,068 --> 01:35:53,164
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

1138
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:59,937
And that, is destiny fulfilled.

1139
01:36:00,649 --> 01:36:03,940
Sire, your Daughter...

1140
01:36:05,549 --> 01:36:06,550
No...

1141
01:36:07,003 --> 01:36:08,292
...is a traitor.

1142
01:36:08,317 --> 01:36:12,976
That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.

1143
01:36:20,034 --> 01:36:21,245
I know.

1144
01:36:22,072 --> 01:36:24,793
And you'll have the
chance to prove it.

1145
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:32,685
No...

1146
01:36:33,248 --> 01:36:34,577
He knows!

1147
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:41,619
Barton? Barton, come in.

1148
01:36:41,682 --> 01:36:45,911
Romanoff? Come in, we
have a problem. Come on!

1149
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:47,694
Come in, we have a prob...

1150
01:36:47,921 --> 01:36:49,774
Thanos knows.

1151
01:36:49,884 --> 01:36:51,190
Thanos...

1152
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:06,242
Cap...

1153
01:37:07,829 --> 01:37:09,896
Sorry, buddy.
We got a problem.

1154
01:37:09,939 --> 01:37:12,433
Huh. Yeah, we do.

1155
01:37:12,699 --> 01:37:14,981
- Well, what are we gonna do now?
- You know what, give me a break, Steve.

1156
01:37:15,007 --> 01:37:16,695
I just got hit in the
head with a Hulk.

1157
01:37:16,829 --> 01:37:19,775
You said that we had one shot.
This, this was our shot.

1158
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,468
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones
or nothing. Six stones or nothing.

1159
01:37:22,494 --> 01:37:24,580
You're repeating yourself, you know
that? You're repeating yourself.

1160
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:26,386
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1161
01:37:26,411 --> 01:37:27,295
- No!
- Come on.

1162
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,617
You never wanted a time heist, you
went on board with the time heist...

1163
01:37:29,642 --> 01:37:31,009
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1164
01:37:31,034 --> 01:37:32,251
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah!

1165
01:37:32,276 --> 01:37:34,189
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1166
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:35,933
No, no, no. There's
no other options.

1167
01:37:35,981 --> 01:37:38,107
There's no do-overs. We're
not going anywhere else.

1168
01:37:38,138 --> 01:37:40,584
We have one particle left. Each.

1169
01:37:40,609 --> 01:37:44,275
That's it, alright? We use that...
Bye, bye. You're not going home.

1170
01:37:44,318 --> 01:37:46,508
Yeah, well if we don't try...

1171
01:37:46,565 --> 01:37:48,353
then no one else is
going home, either.

1172
01:37:48,378 --> 01:37:49,534
I got it.

1173
01:37:49,932 --> 01:37:54,294
There's another way. To retake the
Tesseract and acquire new particles.

1174
01:37:55,068 --> 01:37:58,868
We'll stroll down memory lane.
Military installation, Garden State.

1175
01:38:02,541 --> 01:38:03,932
Why were they both there?

1176
01:38:03,957 --> 01:38:07,169
They were there at a... I've
a vaguely exact idea.

1177
01:38:07,193 --> 01:38:07,990
How vague?

1178
01:38:08,046 --> 01:38:09,272
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?

1179
01:38:09,297 --> 01:38:10,674
- I know for a fact they were there...
- Who's they?

1180
01:38:10,697 --> 01:38:13,423
- What are we doing?
- And I know how I know.

1181
01:38:14,322 --> 01:38:16,385
Guys, what's up? What is it?

1182
01:38:16,551 --> 01:38:18,339
Well, it looks like
we're improvising.

1183
01:38:18,364 --> 01:38:19,863
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

1184
01:38:19,888 --> 01:38:21,983
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1185
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:22,719
Suit up.

1186
01:38:22,751 --> 01:38:23,898
What's in New Jersey?

1187
01:38:23,924 --> 01:38:25,799
- 0-4, 0-4...
- Uhh, 0-7.

1188
01:38:25,824 --> 01:38:26,893
- 0-7.
- Excuse me...

1189
01:38:26,919 --> 01:38:28,403
1-9-7-0.

1190
01:38:28,959 --> 01:38:33,313
- Are you sure?
- Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry.

1191
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:36,577
America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this,

1192
01:38:36,612 --> 01:38:39,629
and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1193
01:38:40,351 --> 01:38:42,675
Thanks for the pep
talk, pissant.

1194
01:38:43,288 --> 01:38:44,554
You trust me?

1195
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:46,196
I do.

1196
01:38:47,674 --> 01:38:48,932
Your call.

1197
01:38:49,847 --> 01:38:51,223
Here we go.

1198
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:08,821
Hey, man!

1199
01:39:09,122 --> 01:39:10,875
Make love, not war!

1200
01:39:17,336 --> 01:39:19,980
Clearly, you weren't
actually born here, right?

1201
01:39:20,005 --> 01:39:21,620
The idea of me was.

1202
01:39:22,371 --> 01:39:24,934
Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a

1203
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:27,850
quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization.

1204
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:30,176
Where do you hide it?

1205
01:39:30,499 --> 01:39:31,871
In plain sight.

1206
01:40:00,704 --> 01:40:02,179
Good luck on your
mission, Captain.

1207
01:40:02,204 --> 01:40:04,449
Good luck on your
project, doctor.

1208
01:40:08,108 --> 01:40:09,452
You're new here?

1209
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:12,876
Not exactly.

1210
01:40:28,358 --> 01:40:29,568
Gotcha.

1211
01:40:47,187 --> 01:40:48,571
Back in the game.

1212
01:40:51,581 --> 01:40:53,340
Arnim, you in there?

1213
01:40:53,653 --> 01:40:54,801
Arnim?

1214
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,032
Hey!

1215
01:41:01,408 --> 01:41:03,330
The door's this way, pal.

1216
01:41:04,394 --> 01:41:05,449
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:41:05,717 --> 01:41:07,490
I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?

1218
01:41:07,515 --> 01:41:11,352
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,
I haven't seen a soul.

1219
01:41:12,582 --> 01:41:13,770
Pardon me.

1220
01:41:14,685 --> 01:41:16,186
Do I know you?

1221
01:41:17,632 --> 01:41:19,679
No, sir. I'm, a...

1222
01:41:20,102 --> 01:41:21,595
visitor from MIT.

1223
01:41:21,735 --> 01:41:23,455
Huh. MIT.

1224
01:41:24,065 --> 01:41:25,371
Got a name?

1225
01:41:25,762 --> 01:41:26,826
Howard.

1226
01:41:26,851 --> 01:41:28,467
Well that'll be
easy to remember.

1227
01:41:28,483 --> 01:41:29,960
Howard...

1228
01:41:30,624 --> 01:41:31,836
...Potts.

1229
01:41:31,861 --> 01:41:33,821
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1230
01:41:34,454 --> 01:41:35,291
Hi.

1231
01:41:35,299 --> 01:41:36,635
Shit. Now, don't pull it.

1232
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:37,692
Yeah...

1233
01:41:39,403 --> 01:41:41,554
You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.

1234
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:43,484
I'm fine. Just, long hours.

1235
01:41:44,016 --> 01:41:45,712
Wanna get some air?

1236
01:41:48,222 --> 01:41:50,966
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah. That would be swell.

1237
01:41:51,036 --> 01:41:52,420
- That way.
- Okay.

1238
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,218
Need your briefcase?

1239
01:41:58,971 --> 01:42:01,332
You're not one of
those, are ya, Potts?

1240
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:08,930
- Hello.
- Dr. Pym?

1241
01:42:08,955 --> 01:42:11,598
That would be the number
that you called. Yes.

1242
01:42:11,623 --> 01:42:14,021
This is Capt. Stevens
from shipping.

1243
01:42:14,046 --> 01:42:16,600
- We have a package for you.
- Bring it up.

1244
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:19,041
Well, that's the thing, sir.
We can't.

1245
01:42:19,907 --> 01:42:22,534
I'm confused. I thought
that was your job.

1246
01:42:22,682 --> 01:42:25,965
Well, it's just... Sir,
the box is glowing and,

1247
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:28,679
to be honest, some of our mail
guys aren't feeling that great.

1248
01:42:28,704 --> 01:42:30,453
They didn't know
better, did they?

1249
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:33,065
Yeah, they did. You
better get down here.

1250
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:36,193
Excuse me.
Out of the way!

1251
01:43:02,782 --> 01:43:06,229
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?

1252
01:43:06,913 --> 01:43:08,579
My wife's expecting.

1253
01:43:08,853 --> 01:43:11,449
And, uh... Too much
time in the office.

1254
01:43:13,356 --> 01:43:15,691
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Hold this, will you?

1255
01:43:15,716 --> 01:43:17,326
Yeah, sure.

1256
01:43:18,089 --> 01:43:20,387
- How far along is she?
- I don't know... uh...

1257
01:43:21,988 --> 01:43:25,029
She's at the point where she can't
stand the sound of my chewing.

1258
01:43:25,099 --> 01:43:28,093
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

1259
01:43:29,107 --> 01:43:30,446
I have a little girl.

1260
01:43:30,471 --> 01:43:34,294
A girl would be nice. Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1261
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:36,418
What'd be so awful about that?

1262
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:39,774
Let's just say that the greater
good has rarely outweighed

1263
01:43:40,531 --> 01:43:42,719
my own self-interests.

1264
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:48,012
- And you've never seen these 2 men before?
- No, I've got an eye for this.

1265
01:43:48,037 --> 01:43:49,930
- The 2 of them looked fishy.
- Can you describe them?

1266
01:43:49,955 --> 01:43:53,189
- Well, one of them had a hippie beard.
- Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1267
01:43:53,214 --> 01:43:54,398
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1268
01:43:54,423 --> 01:43:56,604
Yeah, this is Chesler. I
need every available MPs

1269
01:43:56,629 --> 01:43:58,879
on sub-level 6. We have
a potential breach.

1270
01:45:00,713 --> 01:45:02,417
So, where are you at with names?

1271
01:45:02,442 --> 01:45:05,498
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Almanzo.

1272
01:45:06,444 --> 01:45:08,726
Might wanna let that
stew while you got time.

1273
01:45:10,557 --> 01:45:12,538
Let me ask you a question.

1274
01:45:12,993 --> 01:45:15,158
When your kid was born...

1275
01:45:15,444 --> 01:45:18,511
- were you nervous?
- Wildly. Yeah.

1276
01:45:18,535 --> 01:45:19,918
Did you feel qualified?

1277
01:45:19,943 --> 01:45:23,499
Like you had any idea how to
successfully operate that thing?

1278
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:26,772
I literally pieced it
together as I went along,

1279
01:45:26,827 --> 01:45:29,430
I thought about what
my Dad did, and...

1280
01:45:29,633 --> 01:45:32,533
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1281
01:45:32,658 --> 01:45:34,753
I thought my Dad
was tough on me.

1282
01:45:34,796 --> 01:45:37,785
And now, looking back, I just
remember the good stuff, you know.

1283
01:45:37,841 --> 01:45:40,974
- He did drop the odd pearl.
- Yeah? Like what?

1284
01:45:41,885 --> 01:45:44,637
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

1285
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,092
Smart guy.

1286
01:45:47,116 --> 01:45:48,537
He did his best.

1287
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:51,742
Let me tell you. That
kid's not even here yet

1288
01:45:51,768 --> 01:45:54,096
and, there's nothing I
wouldn't do for him.

1289
01:46:02,393 --> 01:46:03,831
Good to meet you, Potts.

1290
01:46:04,793 --> 01:46:07,021
Yeah, Howard...

1291
01:46:07,916 --> 01:46:09,925
Everything's gonna be all right.

1292
01:46:12,131 --> 01:46:15,641
Thank you for everything...

1293
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,486
...you've done for
this country.

1294
01:46:21,246 --> 01:46:22,411
Jarvis.

1295
01:46:26,109 --> 01:46:27,781
Have we ever met that guy?

1296
01:46:29,601 --> 01:46:31,511
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1297
01:46:34,037 --> 01:46:35,865
Seems very familiar.

1298
01:46:36,655 --> 01:46:38,202
Weird beard, though.

1299
01:46:46,228 --> 01:46:48,966
- You're weak.
- I'm you.

1300
01:47:06,227 --> 01:47:07,688
You can stop this.

1301
01:47:08,439 --> 01:47:10,245
You know you want to.

1302
01:47:11,316 --> 01:47:13,918
Did you see what
happens in the future?

1303
01:47:14,592 --> 01:47:17,078
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1304
01:47:18,493 --> 01:47:20,627
You wanna know how he does that?

1305
01:47:21,722 --> 01:47:26,482
You wanna know, what
he does to you?

1306
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:27,999
That's enough.

1307
01:47:40,136 --> 01:47:41,582
You disgust me.

1308
01:47:43,044 --> 01:47:47,695
But, that doesn't
mean you're useless.

1309
01:48:09,786 --> 01:48:11,326
How do I look?

1310
01:48:18,081 --> 01:48:19,082
Wow...

1311
01:48:19,887 --> 01:48:22,231
Under different circumstances,

1312
01:48:23,089 --> 01:48:25,327
this would be totally awesome.

1313
01:48:37,252 --> 01:48:40,379
I bet the raccoon didn't
have to climb a mountain.

1314
01:48:40,589 --> 01:48:42,575
Technically, he's not
a raccoon, you know.

1315
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,219
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1316
01:48:44,513 --> 01:48:45,514
Welcome.

1317
01:48:48,868 --> 01:48:51,588
Natasha, daughter of Ivan.

1318
01:48:52,587 --> 01:48:55,519
Clint, son of Edith.

1319
01:49:01,706 --> 01:49:02,823
Who are you?

1320
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,036
Consider me a guide.

1321
01:49:06,378 --> 01:49:09,985
To you, and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.

1322
01:49:10,091 --> 01:49:13,559
Okay. You tell us where it is.
Then we'll be on our way.

1323
01:49:17,291 --> 01:49:19,244
If only it were that easy.

1324
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,700
What you seek lies
in front of you...

1325
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:38,531
...as does what you fear.

1326
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,811
The stone is down there.

1327
01:49:46,602 --> 01:49:47,759
For one of you.

1328
01:49:48,948 --> 01:49:50,144
For the other...

1329
01:49:53,154 --> 01:49:57,610
In order to take the stone, you
must lose that which you love.

1330
01:49:59,578 --> 01:50:01,759
An everlasting exchange.

1331
01:50:03,831 --> 01:50:06,970
A soul, for a soul.

1332
01:50:10,335 --> 01:50:11,742
How's it going?

1333
01:50:15,378 --> 01:50:16,378
Jesus...

1334
01:50:17,019 --> 01:50:19,161
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1335
01:50:19,388 --> 01:50:22,797
No. I don't think so.

1336
01:50:23,586 --> 01:50:25,634
Why, 'cause he knows
your Daddy's name?

1337
01:50:27,277 --> 01:50:28,393
I didn't.

1338
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:31,716
Thanos left here with the stone

1339
01:50:32,811 --> 01:50:36,298
without his daughter.
It's not a coincidence.

1340
01:50:37,689 --> 01:50:38,690
Yeah.

1341
01:50:40,745 --> 01:50:42,818
Whatever it takes.

1342
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,642
Whatever it takes.

1343
01:50:53,168 --> 01:50:57,116
If we don't get that stone,
billions of people stay dead.

1344
01:51:00,849 --> 01:51:03,397
Then I guess we both
know who it's gotta be.

1345
01:51:03,758 --> 01:51:05,211
I guess we do.

1346
01:51:13,293 --> 01:51:17,718
I'm starting to think, we mean
different people here, Natasha.

1347
01:51:18,133 --> 01:51:21,541
For the last five years I've been trying
to do one thing: Get to right here.

1348
01:51:21,619 --> 01:51:23,893
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1349
01:51:23,918 --> 01:51:28,467
- Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.
- What, you think I wanna do it?

1350
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:30,880
I'm trying to save
your life, you idiot.

1351
01:51:30,905 --> 01:51:33,054
Yeah well, I don't want
you to, because I...

1352
01:51:34,045 --> 01:51:36,247
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1353
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,986
You know what I've become.

1354
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:44,473
I don't judge people on
their worst mistakes.

1355
01:51:48,664 --> 01:51:50,001
Maybe you should.

1356
01:51:50,876 --> 01:51:52,093
You didn't.

1357
01:51:58,375 --> 01:52:00,798
You're a pain in my
ass, you know that?

1358
01:52:11,689 --> 01:52:12,830
Okay.

1359
01:52:14,816 --> 01:52:16,051
You win.

1360
01:52:22,715 --> 01:52:24,516
Tell my family I love them.

1361
01:52:27,481 --> 01:52:29,037
You tell them yourself.

1362
01:53:01,812 --> 01:53:02,938
Damn you!

1363
01:53:19,154 --> 01:53:20,398
Let me go.

1364
01:53:22,294 --> 01:53:23,295
No.

1365
01:53:25,357 --> 01:53:26,484
Please, no.

1366
01:53:29,382 --> 01:53:30,976
It's okay.

1367
01:53:33,665 --> 01:53:34,702
Please...

1368
01:55:18,938 --> 01:55:20,236
Did we get them all?

1369
01:55:20,853 --> 01:55:23,253
You telling me this'll
actually work?

1370
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,442
Clint, where's Nat?

1371
01:55:58,441 --> 01:56:00,375
Do we know if she had family?

1372
01:56:00,474 --> 01:56:02,639
Yeah. Us.

1373
01:56:04,211 --> 01:56:05,359
What?

1374
01:56:07,635 --> 01:56:08,917
I just asked him a question...

1375
01:56:08,942 --> 01:56:11,066
Yeah, you're acting like she's dead.
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1376
01:56:11,091 --> 01:56:12,999
We have the stones, right?
As long as we have

1377
01:56:13,024 --> 01:56:15,360
the stones, Cap, we can bring
her back, isn't that right?

1378
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:17,730
So stop this shit. We're the
Avengers, get it together.

1379
01:56:17,755 --> 01:56:19,566
We can't get her back.

1380
01:56:22,295 --> 01:56:26,361
- Wha-what?
- It can't be undone. It can't.

1381
01:56:28,967 --> 01:56:32,832
I'm sorry. No offense, but you're
a very earthly being. Okay?

1382
01:56:32,857 --> 01:56:36,250
We're talking about space magic. And
"can't" seems very () don't you think?

1383
01:56:36,281 --> 01:56:39,283
Look, I know that I'm way
outside my paygrade here.

1384
01:56:39,291 --> 01:56:40,854
But she still isn't
here, is she?

1385
01:56:40,879 --> 01:56:44,810
- Now that's my point.
- It can't be undone.

1386
01:56:45,318 --> 01:56:48,671
Or that's at least what the,
red floating guy had to say.

1387
01:56:48,695 --> 01:56:50,343
Maybe you wanna go talk to him?
Okay?

1388
01:56:50,368 --> 01:56:53,808
Go grab your hammer, and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1389
01:57:01,624 --> 01:57:03,624
It was supposed to be me.

1390
01:57:06,283 --> 01:57:10,333
She sacrificed her life for that
goddamned stone. She bet her life on it.

1391
01:57:14,886 --> 01:57:16,793
She's not coming back.

1392
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:21,945
We have to make it worth it.
We have to.

1393
01:57:23,975 --> 01:57:25,093
We will.

1394
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:51,450
Boom!

1395
01:57:56,962 --> 01:57:58,900
All right. The glove's ready.

1396
01:57:59,337 --> 01:58:02,073
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freaking fingers?

1397
01:58:02,487 --> 01:58:03,487
I'll do it.

1398
01:58:03,903 --> 01:58:05,075
- Excuse me?
- It's okay.

1399
01:58:05,099 --> 01:58:06,873
- No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop.
- Hey, hey...

1400
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:07,866
Thor, just wait.

1401
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:10,103
We haven't decided who's
gonna put that on yet.

1402
01:58:10,596 --> 01:58:13,504
I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1403
01:58:13,551 --> 01:58:14,864
We should at least discuss it.

1404
01:58:14,873 --> 01:58:18,718
Look, us sitting here staring at that
thing is not gonna bring everybody back.

1405
01:58:19,747 --> 01:58:22,924
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So
this responsibility falls upon me.

1406
01:58:22,949 --> 01:58:28,117
It's my duty. It's not that... It's...
stop it! Just let me.

1407
01:58:30,616 --> 01:58:34,275
Just let me do it. Just
let me do something good.

1408
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:35,119
- Something great.
- Look...

1409
01:58:35,135 --> 01:58:37,074
It's not just the fact that
that glove is channeling

1410
01:58:37,099 --> 01:58:39,802
enough energy to light up a
continent, I'm telling you

1411
01:58:39,826 --> 01:58:40,827
you're in no condition.

1412
01:58:40,866 --> 01:58:44,157
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1413
01:58:44,182 --> 01:58:45,400
Cheez Whiz?

1414
01:58:48,084 --> 01:58:49,754
- Lightning.
- Yeah.

1415
01:58:49,812 --> 01:58:51,726
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1416
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:53,165
It's gotta be me.

1417
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:58,525
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.
It almost killed him.

1418
01:59:00,342 --> 01:59:02,163
None of you could survive.

1419
01:59:02,615 --> 01:59:04,561
How do we know you will?

1420
01:59:04,577 --> 01:59:08,330
We don't. But the
radiation's mostly gamma.

1421
01:59:11,728 --> 01:59:13,081
It's like...

1422
01:59:15,386 --> 01:59:17,122
I was made for this.

1423
01:59:36,165 --> 01:59:37,995
Good to go, yeah?

1424
01:59:39,762 --> 01:59:41,184
Let's do it.

1425
01:59:41,326 --> 01:59:43,404
You remember everyone
Thanos snapped away five

1426
01:59:43,429 --> 01:59:46,267
years ago and just bringing
them back to now, today.

1427
01:59:46,976 --> 01:59:49,368
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1428
01:59:49,517 --> 01:59:50,518
Got it.

1429
02:00:07,372 --> 02:00:10,147
Friday, do me a favor and
activate protocol 8.

1430
02:00:10,187 --> 02:00:11,335
Yes, boss.

1431
02:00:20,005 --> 02:00:21,646
Everybody comes home.

1432
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:48,409
- Take it off. Take it off!
- No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1433
02:00:49,035 --> 02:00:50,379
Talk to me, Banner.

1434
02:00:53,945 --> 02:00:56,447
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1435
02:01:27,907 --> 02:01:28,928
Bruce!

1436
02:01:30,405 --> 02:01:32,118
Don't move him.

1437
02:01:39,206 --> 02:01:41,981
- Did it work?
- Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.

1438
02:02:27,554 --> 02:02:28,500
Honey.

1439
02:02:29,744 --> 02:02:30,745
Honey.

1440
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:33,051
Guys...

1441
02:02:35,703 --> 02:02:37,422
I think it worked!

1442
02:03:18,995 --> 02:03:21,292
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!
I can't breathe.

1443
02:03:22,519 --> 02:03:24,872
Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.

1444
02:03:31,299 --> 02:03:33,575
Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!

1445
02:03:34,150 --> 02:03:35,682
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1446
02:03:35,994 --> 02:03:37,090
Come on!

1447
02:03:47,182 --> 02:03:48,573
Rhodey!

1448
02:03:56,767 --> 02:04:00,574
Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy?
We're in the lower level, it's flooding!

1449
02:04:00,606 --> 02:04:04,141
- What?
- We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1450
02:04:04,166 --> 02:04:08,130
Wait! I'm here! I'm
here, can you hear me?

1451
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:28,660
Cap?

1452
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:14,440
Daughter.

1453
02:05:14,503 --> 02:05:15,816
Yes, Father.

1454
02:05:17,747 --> 02:05:20,999
So, this is the future.
Well done.

1455
02:05:21,508 --> 02:05:25,056
Thank you, Father. They
suspected nothing.

1456
02:05:27,144 --> 02:05:29,364
The arrogant never do.

1457
02:05:31,444 --> 02:05:32,445
Go.

1458
02:05:33,405 --> 02:05:35,953
Find the stones.
Bring them to me.

1459
02:05:36,219 --> 02:05:37,611
What will you do?

1460
02:05:39,081 --> 02:05:40,207
Wait.

1461
02:06:06,059 --> 02:06:07,951
Tell me something.

1462
02:06:08,556 --> 02:06:12,941
In the future, what
happens to you and me?

1463
02:06:15,484 --> 02:06:16,961
I tried to kill you.

1464
02:06:18,845 --> 02:06:20,017
Several times.

1465
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:24,739
But eventually,
we become friends.

1466
02:06:26,975 --> 02:06:28,687
We become sisters.

1467
02:06:36,212 --> 02:06:37,445
Come on.

1468
02:06:39,339 --> 02:06:40,809
We can stop him.

1469
02:06:49,411 --> 02:06:51,012
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

1470
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:52,608
That's my man.

1471
02:06:53,703 --> 02:06:56,189
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1472
02:06:59,129 --> 02:07:00,497
What happened?

1473
02:07:00,682 --> 02:07:02,831
We messed with time.
It tends to mess back.

1474
02:07:02,856 --> 02:07:03,857
You'll see.

1475
02:07:25,649 --> 02:07:27,501
What's he been doing?

1476
02:07:29,017 --> 02:07:30,774
Absolutely nothing.

1477
02:07:32,309 --> 02:07:33,825
Where are the stones?

1478
02:07:34,348 --> 02:07:36,311
Lost somewhere under all this.

1479
02:07:37,531 --> 02:07:39,837
All I know is he
doesn't have them.

1480
02:07:40,165 --> 02:07:41,759
So we keep it that way.

1481
02:07:41,784 --> 02:07:44,239
- You know it's a trap, right?
- Yeah...

1482
02:07:44,715 --> 02:07:46,355
I don't much care.

1483
02:07:46,975 --> 02:07:48,050
Good.

1484
02:07:49,132 --> 02:07:51,734
Just as long as we're
all in agreement.

1485
02:08:01,406 --> 02:08:03,675
Let's kill him
properly this time.

1486
02:08:12,704 --> 02:08:15,439
You could not live
with your own failure.

1487
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:19,024
Where did that bring you?

1488
02:08:22,063 --> 02:08:23,385
Back to me.

1489
02:08:27,317 --> 02:08:29,920
I thought by eliminating
half of life,

1490
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:33,006
the other half would thrive.

1491
02:08:33,375 --> 02:08:37,886
But you've shown me,
that's impossible.

1492
02:08:39,516 --> 02:08:42,901
And as long as there are those
that remember what was,

1493
02:08:42,926 --> 02:08:48,172
there will always be those that
are unable to accept what can be.

1494
02:08:48,867 --> 02:08:50,282
They will resist.

1495
02:08:50,579 --> 02:08:52,781
Yep. We're all
kinds of stubborn.

1496
02:08:53,511 --> 02:08:55,137
I'm thankful.

1497
02:08:57,303 --> 02:09:01,211
Because now, I know
what I must do.

1498
02:09:01,884 --> 02:09:07,144
I will shred this universe
down to its last atom.

1499
02:09:07,927 --> 02:09:09,342
And then...

1500
02:09:09,667 --> 02:09:14,560
With the stones you've collected
for me, create a new one.

1501
02:09:15,093 --> 02:09:16,891
Teeming with life,

1502
02:09:17,252 --> 02:09:22,015
that knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given.

1503
02:09:24,677 --> 02:09:26,287
A grateful universe.

1504
02:09:26,809 --> 02:09:28,280
Born out of blood.

1505
02:09:28,437 --> 02:09:30,110
They'll never know it.

1506
02:09:31,141 --> 02:09:33,810
Because you won't be
alive to tell them.

1507
02:09:49,050 --> 02:09:50,660
See you on the other side, man.

1508
02:09:52,287 --> 02:09:54,522
Hang on! I'm coming!

1509
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:41,956
Oh, hey...

1510
02:10:42,011 --> 02:10:43,715
I know you.

1511
02:10:46,951 --> 02:10:50,187
Father. I have the stones.

1512
02:10:50,266 --> 02:10:51,267
What?!

1513
02:10:52,494 --> 02:10:53,603
Stop.

1514
02:10:58,559 --> 02:11:00,380
You're betraying us?

1515
02:11:06,088 --> 02:11:07,956
You don't have to do this.

1516
02:11:10,223 --> 02:11:13,146
I am... this.

1517
02:11:13,178 --> 02:11:15,031
No, you're not.

1518
02:11:15,195 --> 02:11:17,243
You've seen what we become.

1519
02:11:23,290 --> 02:11:24,745
Nebula, listen to her.

1520
02:11:26,989 --> 02:11:28,262
You can change.

1521
02:11:34,453 --> 02:11:35,806
He won't let me.

1522
02:11:37,682 --> 02:11:38,682
No!

1523
02:11:57,741 --> 02:11:59,743
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1524
02:12:15,714 --> 02:12:17,223
Boss, wake up.

1525
02:13:08,339 --> 02:13:09,574
I knew it!

1526
02:14:32,233 --> 02:14:34,571
In all my years of conquest...

1527
02:14:35,838 --> 02:14:37,081
violence...

1528
02:14:38,793 --> 02:14:39,981
slaughter...

1529
02:14:41,881 --> 02:14:43,564
It was never personal.

1530
02:14:46,955 --> 02:14:48,682
But I'll tell you now...

1531
02:14:51,125 --> 02:14:53,793
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

1532
02:14:54,471 --> 02:14:56,699
annoying little planet...

1533
02:14:58,942 --> 02:15:03,749
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Very, very much.

1534
02:16:08,061 --> 02:16:09,569
Cap, you hear me?

1535
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:17,571
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

1536
02:16:21,812 --> 02:16:23,140
On your left.

1537
02:17:48,682 --> 02:17:50,049
Is that everyone?

1538
02:17:50,347 --> 02:17:51,879
What, you wanted more?

1539
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,859
Avengers...

1540
02:18:25,923 --> 02:18:27,181
...assemble.

1541
02:19:23,975 --> 02:19:25,491
No, no. Give me that.

1542
02:19:25,529 --> 02:19:27,248
You have the little one.

1543
02:19:40,639 --> 02:19:41,640
Hey!

1544
02:19:42,355 --> 02:19:43,386
Holy cow.

1545
02:19:43,434 --> 02:19:46,654
You will not believe what's been going on.
Do you remember when we were in space?

1546
02:19:46,679 --> 02:19:50,391
And I got all dusty? I must've passed out,
'cause I woke up, and you were gone.

1547
02:19:50,416 --> 02:19:52,385
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
He was like,

1548
02:19:52,410 --> 02:19:54,289
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us!"

1549
02:19:54,314 --> 02:19:56,821
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time...

1550
02:19:56,846 --> 02:19:58,557
What are you doing?

1551
02:20:03,170 --> 02:20:04,327
This is nice.

1552
02:20:26,511 --> 02:20:27,770
Gamora?

1553
02:20:36,785 --> 02:20:38,636
I thought I lost you.

1554
02:20:43,172 --> 02:20:45,908
Don't... touch... me!

1555
02:20:49,065 --> 02:20:50,651
You missed the first time...

1556
02:20:51,223 --> 02:20:53,755
then you got them
both the second time.

1557
02:20:55,351 --> 02:20:57,625
This is the one? Seriously?

1558
02:20:57,694 --> 02:21:00,257
The choices were him, or a tree.

1559
02:21:10,532 --> 02:21:13,854
Cap, what do you want me to
do with this damn thing?

1560
02:21:15,825 --> 02:21:18,185
Get those stones as
far away as possible!

1561
02:21:18,202 --> 02:21:19,319
No!

1562
02:21:20,328 --> 02:21:22,627
We need to get them back
where they came from.

1563
02:21:22,652 --> 02:21:25,293
No way to get them back. Thanos
destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1564
02:21:25,356 --> 02:21:26,458
Hold on!

1565
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:30,069
That wasn't our
only time machine.

1566
02:21:36,014 --> 02:21:38,259
Anyone see an ugly
brown van out there?

1567
02:21:38,509 --> 02:21:39,290
Yes!

1568
02:21:39,337 --> 02:21:41,603
But you're not gonna
like where it's parked.

1569
02:21:41,628 --> 02:21:44,879
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

1570
02:21:45,255 --> 02:21:46,455
Maybe ten minutes.

1571
02:21:46,459 --> 02:21:48,265
Get it started. We'll
get the stones to you.

1572
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,798
We're on it, Cap.

1573
02:21:59,524 --> 02:22:00,525
Hey.

1574
02:22:00,845 --> 02:22:03,823
You said one out of 14
million, we win, yeah?

1575
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:06,016
Tell me this is it.

1576
02:22:06,255 --> 02:22:09,522
If I tell you what
happens, it won't happen.

1577
02:22:13,187 --> 02:22:14,750
You better be right.

1578
02:22:22,544 --> 02:22:24,012
It's a mess back here.

1579
02:22:24,422 --> 02:22:26,837
It's... it's dead.

1580
02:22:27,024 --> 02:22:28,485
- What?
- It's dead.

1581
02:22:28,768 --> 02:22:30,394
I have to hotwire it.

1582
02:22:33,067 --> 02:22:34,569
Where's Nebula?

1583
02:22:35,218 --> 02:22:37,091
She's not responding.

1584
02:22:37,167 --> 02:22:38,168
Sire!

1585
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:49,304
Clint!

1586
02:22:51,543 --> 02:22:52,851
Give it to me.

1587
02:23:15,059 --> 02:23:18,586
You took everything from me.

1588
02:23:18,711 --> 02:23:20,860
I don't even know who you are.

1589
02:23:21,252 --> 02:23:22,478
You will.

1590
02:23:45,043 --> 02:23:46,043
I got it!

1591
02:23:48,678 --> 02:23:50,342
Activate Instant Kill!

1592
02:24:13,753 --> 02:24:15,043
Rain fire!

1593
02:24:15,340 --> 02:24:17,590
But Sire, our troops!

1594
02:24:17,638 --> 02:24:18,896
Just do it!

1595
02:24:40,049 --> 02:24:41,667
Is anyone else seeing this?

1596
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:56,598
I got this.

1597
02:24:56,801 --> 02:24:57,802
I got this!

1598
02:24:57,857 --> 02:24:59,170
Okay, I don't got this.

1599
02:24:59,178 --> 02:25:02,547
- Help! Somebody, help!
- Hey, Queens. Heads up.

1600
02:25:12,313 --> 02:25:14,181
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1601
02:25:17,104 --> 02:25:18,223
Hey! Nice to meet...

1602
02:25:18,245 --> 02:25:19,400
Oh! My God!

1603
02:25:56,556 --> 02:25:57,979
What the hell is this?

1604
02:25:58,370 --> 02:25:59,760
Friday, what are they firing at?

1605
02:25:59,785 --> 02:26:02,247
Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.

1606
02:26:15,053 --> 02:26:16,617
Oh, yeah!

1607
02:26:37,081 --> 02:26:39,513
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1608
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:50,785
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

1609
02:26:51,344 --> 02:26:54,532
Hey, Peter Parker. You
got something for me?

1610
02:27:00,171 --> 02:27:03,485
I don't know how you're
gonna get through all that.

1611
02:27:04,134 --> 02:27:05,314
Don't worry.

1612
02:27:06,292 --> 02:27:07,785
She's got help.

1613
02:29:55,541 --> 02:29:59,087
I am... inevitable.

1614
02:30:19,285 --> 02:30:20,363
And I...

1615
02:30:22,530 --> 02:30:23,741
am...

1616
02:30:27,407 --> 02:30:28,705
...Iron Man.

1617
02:32:27,435 --> 02:32:28,779
Mr. Stark?

1618
02:32:29,654 --> 02:32:30,655
Hey...

1619
02:32:31,812 --> 02:32:34,799
Mr. Stark? Can you hear me?

1620
02:32:34,844 --> 02:32:36,188
It's Peter.

1621
02:32:40,341 --> 02:32:41,802
We won.

1622
02:32:42,178 --> 02:32:43,178
Mr. Stark...

1623
02:32:45,203 --> 02:32:47,188
We won, Mr. Stark.

1624
02:32:48,727 --> 02:32:51,417
We won and you did it, sir.
You did it.

1625
02:32:53,019 --> 02:32:55,357
I'm sorry... Tony...

1626
02:33:08,939 --> 02:33:11,549
- Hey.
- Hey, Pep...

1627
02:33:16,190 --> 02:33:19,738
- Friday?
- Life functions critical.

1628
02:33:28,830 --> 02:33:29,917
Tony.

1629
02:33:31,230 --> 02:33:32,542
Look at me.

1630
02:33:34,873 --> 02:33:36,436
We're gonna be okay.

1631
02:33:41,517 --> 02:33:43,309
You can rest now.

1632
02:35:28,494 --> 02:35:31,035
Everybody wants a
happy ending, right?

1633
02:35:31,691 --> 02:35:34,093
But it doesn't always
roll that way.

1634
02:35:35,866 --> 02:35:37,372
Maybe this time.

1635
02:35:39,149 --> 02:35:41,744
I'm hoping if you
play this back,

1636
02:35:43,339 --> 02:35:45,082
it's in celebration.

1637
02:35:45,958 --> 02:35:48,164
I hope families are reunited,

1638
02:35:48,235 --> 02:35:50,471
I hope we get it back,
and something like a

1639
02:35:50,496 --> 02:35:52,978
normal version of the
planet has been restored.

1640
02:35:53,809 --> 02:35:56,192
If there ever was such a thing.

1641
02:35:56,459 --> 02:35:57,937
God, what a world.

1642
02:35:58,203 --> 02:35:59,914
Universe, now.

1643
02:36:00,571 --> 02:36:02,690
If you told me ten years
ago that we weren't alone,

1644
02:36:02,715 --> 02:36:04,214
let alone, you know,
to this extent,

1645
02:36:04,238 --> 02:36:07,841
I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised.
But come on, you know?

1646
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:12,673
That epic forces of darkness and
light that have come into play.

1647
02:36:13,205 --> 02:36:14,873
And, for better or worse,

1648
02:36:15,037 --> 02:36:18,790
that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.

1649
02:36:22,686 --> 02:36:25,070
So I found the time and I
recorded a little greeting...

1650
02:36:25,158 --> 02:36:28,182
In the case of an untimely death.
On my part.

1651
02:36:28,503 --> 02:36:32,021
Not that, death in any
time isn't untimely.

1652
02:36:32,583 --> 02:36:34,972
This time travel thing that we're
gonna try and pull off tomorrow,

1653
02:36:34,997 --> 02:36:37,225
it's, it's got me scratching
my head about this.

1654
02:36:41,668 --> 02:36:45,053
But then again, that's the hero gig.
Part of the journey is the end.

1655
02:36:47,984 --> 02:36:52,582
Everything's gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.

1656
02:36:55,438 --> 02:36:57,074
I love you 3,000.

1657
02:39:11,986 --> 02:39:14,105
You know, I wish
there was a way...

1658
02:39:14,199 --> 02:39:16,012
that I could let her know.

1659
02:39:17,997 --> 02:39:19,397
That we won.

1660
02:39:21,617 --> 02:39:22,859
We did it.

1661
02:39:26,878 --> 02:39:27,956
She knows.

1662
02:39:33,626 --> 02:39:34,906
They both do.

1663
02:39:44,579 --> 02:39:46,047
How you doing, Squirt?

1664
02:39:46,049 --> 02:39:48,136
- Good.
- You good?

1665
02:39:48,261 --> 02:39:50,997
- Okay. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

1666
02:39:51,545 --> 02:39:54,749
- What do you want?
- Cheeseburgers.

1667
02:39:59,444 --> 02:40:02,391
You know your Dad
liked cheeseburgers?

1668
02:40:05,948 --> 02:40:08,559
I'm gonna get you all the
cheeseburgers you want.

1669
02:40:08,575 --> 02:40:09,576
Okay.

1670
02:40:26,296 --> 02:40:30,033
So, when can we expect you back?

1671
02:40:32,348 --> 02:40:36,240
- About that...
- Thor. Your people need a king.

1672
02:40:36,356 --> 02:40:38,567
No, they already have one.

1673
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:41,679
That's funny.

1674
02:40:46,753 --> 02:40:48,214
You're being serious?

1675
02:40:52,304 --> 02:40:54,588
It's time for me to be
who I am rather than

1676
02:40:55,173 --> 02:40:57,432
who I'm supposed to be.

1677
02:40:58,864 --> 02:41:02,771
But you, you're a leader.
That's who you are.

1678
02:41:05,426 --> 02:41:07,708
You know I'd make a lot
of changes around here.

1679
02:41:07,733 --> 02:41:10,915
I'm counting on it.
Your Majesty.

1680
02:41:20,980 --> 02:41:22,317
What will you do?

1681
02:41:22,700 --> 02:41:23,919
I'm not sure.

1682
02:41:24,561 --> 02:41:27,015
For the first time in a
thousand years, I...

1683
02:41:27,187 --> 02:41:29,837
I have no path. I do
have a ride, though.

1684
02:41:29,931 --> 02:41:32,159
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

1685
02:41:36,114 --> 02:41:37,646
Well, here we are.

1686
02:41:38,117 --> 02:41:40,305
Tree! Good to see you.

1687
02:41:42,541 --> 02:41:43,541
Well...

1688
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:47,232
The As-Guardians of the
Galaxy back together again.

1689
02:41:48,275 --> 02:41:49,781
Where to first?

1690
02:41:52,721 --> 02:41:55,957
Just so you know, this is my ship still.
I'm in charge.

1691
02:41:56,300 --> 02:41:58,857
I know. I know. Of
course, you are.

1692
02:41:59,123 --> 02:42:00,335
Of course.

1693
02:42:02,907 --> 02:42:05,924
See, you say of course, but
then you touch the map.

1694
02:42:05,949 --> 02:42:08,833
It makes you think that maybe you
didn't realize I was in charge.

1695
02:42:08,935 --> 02:42:12,180
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there. Okay?

1696
02:42:12,196 --> 02:42:14,391
I'm merely trying to be of service.
An assistant.

1697
02:42:14,416 --> 02:42:16,733
- Quill.
- That's what I said.

1698
02:42:16,758 --> 02:42:19,024
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

1699
02:42:19,165 --> 02:42:20,595
Sounds fair.

1700
02:42:23,192 --> 02:42:24,880
- It's not necessary.
- It's not.

1701
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:25,505
Okay?

1702
02:42:25,530 --> 02:42:28,172
I got some blasters unless
you guys wanna use knives.

1703
02:42:28,202 --> 02:42:30,382
Oh, yes. Please, use knives.

1704
02:42:30,406 --> 02:42:31,686
Yeah, knives.

1705
02:42:31,711 --> 02:42:33,101
I am Groot.

1706
02:42:39,609 --> 02:42:40,610
Not necessary.

1707
02:42:40,657 --> 02:42:42,555
There shall be no
knifing one another.

1708
02:42:42,580 --> 02:42:45,191
Everybody knows who's in charge.

1709
02:42:48,857 --> 02:42:49,991
Me.

1710
02:42:51,482 --> 02:42:52,482
I am.

1711
02:42:53,383 --> 02:42:56,284
Yes, you! Of course!

1712
02:42:56,651 --> 02:42:59,153
Of course. Of course.

1713
02:43:01,561 --> 02:43:02,647
Remember...

1714
02:43:04,029 --> 02:43:06,390
You have to return the stones at
the exact moment you got them.

1715
02:43:06,414 --> 02:43:09,876
Or you're gonna open up a bunch
of nasty alternative realities.

1716
02:43:09,901 --> 02:43:12,618
Don't worry, Bruce.
Clip all the branches.

1717
02:43:13,614 --> 02:43:15,099
You know, I tried.

1718
02:43:16,757 --> 02:43:20,477
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.

1719
02:43:24,336 --> 02:43:27,580
- I miss them, man.
- Me, too.

1720
02:43:31,160 --> 02:43:34,131
You know, if you want,
I can come with you.

1721
02:43:36,216 --> 02:43:37,959
You're a good man, Sam.

1722
02:43:38,082 --> 02:43:40,129
This one's on me, though.

1723
02:43:44,047 --> 02:43:46,564
Don't do anything stupid
'till I get back.

1724
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:51,197
How can I? You're taking
all the stupid with you.

1725
02:43:58,703 --> 02:44:00,234
Gonna miss you, Buddy.

1726
02:44:00,468 --> 02:44:02,329
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

1727
02:44:09,596 --> 02:44:11,690
How long is this gonna take?

1728
02:44:11,816 --> 02:44:14,822
For him? As long as he
needs, For us, five seconds.

1729
02:44:19,717 --> 02:44:20,968
Ready, Cap?

1730
02:44:21,265 --> 02:44:23,860
Alright. We'll meet
you back here, okay?

1731
02:44:24,025 --> 02:44:25,274
You bet.

1732
02:44:26,338 --> 02:44:31,224
Going quantum. Three..
Two.. one...

1733
02:44:32,968 --> 02:44:39,948
And returning in, five,
four, three, two, one...

1734
02:44:47,309 --> 02:44:48,560
Where is he?

1735
02:44:48,607 --> 02:44:51,905
I don't know. He blew right by his
time stamp. He should be here.

1736
02:44:57,508 --> 02:44:58,873
- Well, get him back.
- I'm trying.

1737
02:44:58,898 --> 02:45:01,384
- Get him the hell back.
- I said, I'm trying!

1738
02:45:01,454 --> 02:45:02,540
Sam.

1739
02:45:25,746 --> 02:45:27,089
Go ahead.

1740
02:45:45,371 --> 02:45:46,372
Cap?

1741
02:45:48,295 --> 02:45:49,733
Hi, Sam.

1742
02:45:53,191 --> 02:45:56,253
So did something go wrong,
or did something go right?

1743
02:45:58,186 --> 02:46:01,814
Well, after I put the
stones back, I thought...

1744
02:46:03,315 --> 02:46:07,350
Maybe I'll try some
of that life Tony was...

1745
02:46:07,951 --> 02:46:09,811
telling me to get.

1746
02:46:11,931 --> 02:46:14,103
How did that work out for you?

1747
02:46:16,488 --> 02:46:17,879
It was beautiful.

1748
02:46:19,403 --> 02:46:21,919
I'm happy for you. Truly.

1749
02:46:22,883 --> 02:46:24,008
Thank you.

1750
02:46:25,549 --> 02:46:27,682
Only thing bumming me
out is the fact I have

1751
02:46:27,707 --> 02:46:30,192
to live in a world
without Captain America.

1752
02:46:31,130 --> 02:46:32,131
Oh...

1753
02:46:34,336 --> 02:46:36,067
That reminds me...

1754
02:46:45,524 --> 02:46:46,906
Try it on.

1755
02:47:12,233 --> 02:47:13,624
How's it feel?

1756
02:47:16,102 --> 02:47:18,103
Like it's someone else's.

1757
02:47:21,035 --> 02:47:22,345
It isn't.

1758
02:47:35,547 --> 02:47:36,758
Thank you.

1759
02:47:38,923 --> 02:47:40,554
I'll do my best.

1760
02:47:45,684 --> 02:47:47,559
That's why it's yours.

1761
02:47:49,329 --> 02:47:51,197
You wanna tell me about her?

1762
02:47:57,119 --> 02:47:58,120
No.

1763
02:47:59,119 --> 02:48:00,949
No, I don't think I will.
